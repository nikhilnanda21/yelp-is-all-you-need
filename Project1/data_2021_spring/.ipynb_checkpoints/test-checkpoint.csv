The buffet was really good. It tasted fresh. There was not a lot on the buffet but you could order plates and it was included. We ordered huevos rancheros and a fruit plate on the side. They came out fresh and super tasty. We also had about 7 mimosas each. They had 3 different kinds. I recommend the tamarindo mimosa and the glasses were so fun.It was so delish. The best part was you could barely taste the juice because it was mostly champagne. The service was really friendly even when we knocked over our glasses. I highly recommend going here.,2,cCtB72I6FfLDcU7Zk67N9g

One of the kids is allergic to lactose, so when we asked if they have lactose free milk or any other substitute, he was very uninterested, saying ""No"".

However, after that, the finished looked tired, old and I was unable to clean and polish them back to their original color and shine.   

That brought us to call Chuck at Cabinet Coatings of America.   I wanted an updated look that would be durable and lasting without the constant oiling and polishing, and without having to purchase new cabinets.    We picked out a new color (fudge truffle) and placed the order.   

Chuck said that on day one, they would take all the cabinets doors and drawers off to take them to their shop and the frames would be cleaned, sanded and redone.   That they would be here at 7:30 AM to start the job.

Day one, John was here promptly at 7:30 AM (we liked that).    The entire crew was courteous, professional and a joy to have in our home.    I would recommend Cabinet Coatings of America to anyone that needs or wants a new look without the expense of replacing your cabinets.  

The cabinets look great!   Thank you John, Robin, Tim, Dave and Chuck.  Our kitchen and baths never looked better!

The downside, my fiance ordered the ""calzone pizza"" you can see that this is listed for yourself under the pizza section here: http://www.cibophoenix.com/cena.pdf. Across from it you see the ""Crostone"" which is described as being a calzone. You can see where this is going. They served up a calzone. We asked a gentleman working there about it- he was clueless as to what might even be on the menu- and then made us feel crazy. Then the waitress came over and we asked her and she said that both of those menu items are calzones. Which is strange since one is described as a calzone- they other as an actual pizza. 
She said this happens ""all the time."" 
That's fine but either change your menu, or let someone know when they are ordering it that they are NOT ordering a pizza. I will also say that the pecorino cheese on the pear salad is cut so thick that in the candle light it looked like jicama. The service continues to be bad, we waited time and time again for water, they never asked if we wanted to order more wine, and the check came quickly, but it was with our credit-card on the table for about 20 mins. SERIOUSLY! Also, they seem to have some kind of ant problem in the courtyard- we were bit up before we even ordered.

She is amazingly talented with color, cuts, styling...you name it.  When I first started going to Ti, she took the time to listen and really understand my style.

There were about 4 people ahead of us. Going in was cool 'cause there was an observant host. The guy was pretty badass looking - tattoos, ear piercings with a raspy tone of voice. LOL. But totally nice. He noticed I had gotten to the door before a couple, and was like ""Hey guys, I'm going to put her down first since she rolled up before you. Is that okay?"" Totally considerate, but I didn't wanna impede on another couple's date day, so I let him take their name down first instead. Same guy chatted it up with everyone that was waiting, wished everyone a good day when they left, and still managed to keep track of tables to fill, etc. 
Once seated, the good vibes and customer service didn't stop with him. We had Jasmine as our waitress, and she was extremely sweet and polite. She constantly checked up on us, even after we paid as we finished up the meals. Liked how she kept my coffee topped off 'cause I definitely needed it that morning/afternoon. Food was definitely tasty, came out warm from the kitchen, and was a decent portion for breakfast/brunch. 
Random, surprising moment of the meal was when my boyfriend got his burger, flipped the top bun off to spread ketchup, and the same host was like ""Hey buddy, lemme get you different lettuce... If my lettuce looked like that, I wouldn't want it."" The lettuce was seriously no big deal to the boyfriend (were pieces closest to lettuce head's core), but he definitely appreciated the consideration and attention to detail the guy gave/had.

When we cut into the cake, it also looked like a kindergardener had executed the work. Three layers in a 6 inch cake? wtf? They were all different sizes and looked like they were scraps from another cake. I was ok with all of this if it tasted good. Well, that dream was shattered as I tasted my first bite. The ""buttercream"" icing tasted like someone had an accident and mistook ""one tablespoon - almond extract"" for ""one cup - almond extract.

I pulled into the drive thru and it didn't take long to hear Maria's lovely voice over the speaker box. I asked her for some time to decide on what I was looking to pick up because I wanted an assorted dozen. (Mmm)

I was given ample time to decide and did not feel rushed in the slightest. So I said I was prepared to order and Maria was there in a jiffy just as prepared if not more prepared than I to take my order. 

So I gave her my order flawlessly and she received in perfectly. I then pull up and she had my total for me at the window. We continued the exchange as any drive thru exchange would continue until the very end. 

This is where Maria really showed that she and her shop are a cut above the rest. She leans out the very narrow drive thru window risking intense sun burn and heat exhaustion in this Arizona (nearly) summer heat to ask me if I need any napkins. I was impressed with her bravery and care. I requested just one napkin because I only thought I would need one. But Maria leaves and swiftly returns with my donuts and hands them over to me and then tells me that she has given me two napkins. Turns out Maria knows me better than I even know myself.

Even with the place as busy as it was; and even though I had gotten a little cranky after my wait, the staff remained friendly, accommodating, and kept working up a storm.

And in all of it, J still made sure to give every person a nice comment, a thank you for coming, etc. 
Now for the food:  To put it simply; it was AMAZING. Juicy, tender fish, light batter, freshly made thick cut fries, and all piping hot still by the time I got home with it. All for an amazing price. I'm not much of a fish snob, so I just went with the haddock, and for $6 for a nice piece of fish and more fries than I expected, who could complain?

The spice and sauces are delicious. Can't say no to wings. But believe me they get you on the fries and ranch. For a tiny ranch it was 1.25. For that price I'd rather bring ranch in my purse! 

For four of us (18 wings each), a large fry, 2 drinks and 3 sides of ranch  it came to 58 bucks. Next time I think I""ll Try wing king especially since the service was so so. On the plus side a manager did come by and introduce himself which was refreshing",6,WaAOt_eG0_-yLpG3fI--3g

I remember having a lovely meal there with my family some years ago. When I saw it in Caesar's I was so excited, and I knew I had to try it again. It did not disappoint. We got this $50 prix fix, which included a glass of champagne, amuse bouche, three courses, and a glass of wine to pair with the entree. Great deal and delicious, what more could you ask for?

For the amuse bouche we got lobster sliders. My friend is not a fan of seafood, but she still ate this and liked it. I wish the lobster taste could have been a little stronger though. For appetizer she got the onion soup and I got the salad. Her onion soup is one of the best I've had, it was warming and sweet. The salad was also delicious, the bacon bits added a crunch and saltiness that I enjoyed. For entree I had the fish and my friend ordered the filet mignon, though we ended up switching. The filet mignon was cooked perfectly (I like it still red-ish in the middle), and the peppercorn sauce was flavorful and so scrumptious. 

For dessert we got two of the choices from the patisserie. I honestly can't remember their names now, but one dessert particularly stood out. It had raspberry and chocolate mousse, but there were flavors infused into each other and such, and even the marshmallows on top were special. All the flavors and the textures worked together - nothing was too overpowering or sweet. It was one of my favorite desserts I have had at a restaurant.",4,nQjgUGEBOu-jsCQlp43WGA

I've lived in various apartment communities and this place is one of the worst I've yet to experience. The front office is bad at best. They're slow to fix complaints and maintenance, while also being unnecessarily condescending and rude in the process. Most of our dealings have been with Todd, and he is borderline incompetent. He seems to know the rudiments of the job, and that's about it. I am actually shocked at the 4 star rating overall, because I can't imagine someone giving this place above a 3 star.

On a more positive note, the location is really wonderful, but it's just infuriating dealing with a front office that doesn't even know you live there. Also, they start a hundred different projects and then don't finish any of them for months. This causes inconvenience like something I've never experienced before. They seem to be building a moat around our apartment building, and we're trying to turn the entire front half of the complex into an old western town with true dirt roads. But I don't think that's their goal. Through and through it just seems like one of the worst managed apartment complexes I've ever had the displeasure of seeing. DO NOT MOVE HERE.

The ambiance is nice (although the country music channel their TV is stuck on is a little strange) and the service is good, but... the food was just so terrible that I can't give anything more than a 1 Star rating. 

Our table ordered the Pad See Ew, Pad Thai, and Silver Noodle soup, along with an egg roll appetizer. The egg rolls were decent, if a little oily - sadly, that was the best bite I had of the evening. Everything else was just so greasy, oily, and relatively tasteless, that I could only stand eating the food for the first 2 minutes. After that, the piping-hot temperature that was making the food half-bearable gave way to terrible lack of taste and an inedibly slimy texture for everything. We all agreed that it was a pretty bad food night. 

This has to be one of the first times that I didn't finish the food at a restaurant - I usually finish my entree, and if I don't, I always make sure to take the leftovers home. But not this time, which is a minor anti-miracle in my food-universe. I didn't take anything home from our evening at Corner Thai, besides a bad taste in the mouth and a bit of pity for the nice server who had to listen to that country music station all day.

The calamari was tender and cooked to perfection. My guest shared this and also really enjoyed it. As my other course, I ordered the Mussels and frites, which were cooked perfectly, tender, with a nice white wine broth and plated with the frites resting on top. Excellent!

Thankfully, I only have one prescription I have to deal with and just have to go by once a month. But, on that monthly trip I'm immediately irritated if I go inside. Generally I'm the only person at the Rx counter and there are 2-4 employees working. No one acknowledges you for at least 1-2 minutes; it's like they have a timer and can't speak before it goes off. Then, all they say is ""Be right with you"".  When someone does finally ask your name they dig through, find your Rx, make you sign the insurance book and cash you out with no more words. It's really amazing how little communication goes on. 

The drive-thru pickup, if it doesn't have a long-line is slightly better for some reason. Not personable at all but at least a bit quicker.

Their lattes a DEliCious ! And I absolutely adore the designs they creat with the foam! I also saw a person next to me have a purple latte! Pretty cool! My husband had their breakfast dish with Tinga and I had their popular hash dish. They were both really good I just wish the food could have been a bit warmer. Kinda felt like it had been sitting out for a while till they brought it out for us. Also taking one star off due to the length of time it took for us to receive our food(we went on a Tuesday and it wasn't really full with customers). Also I had ordered my latte and the server forgot about it! But still loved the place and will for sure come back!

They are so light, perfect amount of sweetness and their SYRUP is SO AWESOME. Wow, I think I conveyed my craving and excitement enough - sorry caps lock police. They also offer a cornish hen for brunch - which is a treat. Any place you can have something a little fancier/different with your standard eggs brunch is superb in my books.

But, do you know what the best part of LPD is?! The fact that I can order a savoury and sweet brunch in one plate. E.g. eggs benny with waffles! I honestly could not ask for more from a breakfast establishment.

(I think I'll go here this weekend...)

It's true, the lines are ridiculous. I've swung by at prime brunch hour and the line was long enough to make me turn around and go to an alternative, but the line at 2pm - 2:30pm is bearable (just watch out, they close around 3).

I don't notice it, but many say the cooking is different; One is more modern/fusion (LTH), while the other was more classic Canton.

Either way, I still think the food is very good. And so does my family as we loved LTH when it was open. And since my family were familiar with staff at LTH, nothing much has changed for us. Service is still excellent (we love it how we get our special hot sauce when we come). And the food? They now have Egg Tarts for Dim Sum (I still remember the dismay when they removed that from the menu). And anyone remember those long, fried, shrimp rolls at LTH? Yup! They have brought that classic over here!

 Anywhere that you can enjoy animals in their own natural surrounding, I am an instant fan. I got to get up real close to some Canadian Geese grazing on the grass with their little ones and we also walked along the lake and saw a family of Mallard Ducks, what looked like a Sandpiper, and a Moorhen species. It is totally therapeutic and very enjoyable doing so, but I have a big concern that irritates the F out of me!!!

Hopefully The City of Henderson Parks and Recreation   will enforce a rule that prohibits anyone from feeding the wildlife. If you've been to Hemenway Park in Boulder City, Big Horn Sheep come down during the hot summer  months  from the hillside to graze. You are allowed to see/watch them, but you aren't allowed to feed or come in contact  with the sheep at any time or face a stiff fine. I strongly feel that the waterfowl that frequent Cornerstone Park should have the same respect! 

By feeding the wildlife, you are disrupting their way of life finding food for themselves. Observing them at close range when we first got there, all the geese were just fine grazing on the grass, bugs, and other insects. The ducks, moorhen, and sandpiper were seen also fending for themselves with insects and small fish in the lake/marsh area. They DO NOT need to be fed any type of human food, and  by doing so, you are only letting them get  accustomed to "" human handouts"" also contributing to future health issues, and even affecting their migratory  process over the years. These creatures will also lose their fear of humans and become very aggressive. If you've been to Haunauma Bay on Oahu back in the day  and tried to feed the fish while snorkeling  you know what I'm talking about. (They have banned the feeding of fish for some time now)

During our last  few minutes at the park, I saw a family with a bag of  hot dog  buns heading towards the lake, and this other guy scatter a bag of popcorn all over the grass causing the geese to get aggressive with each other. Totally different scenario from when we first saw them. If no such rule gets enforced, it'll become a mess like Sunset  Park and Aliante Nature Discovery Park  is. Have fun, bring  the family, respect the surroundings , and feed your face if you need to...NOT THE WILDLIFE!!!! ALOHA!!!

My quick tips:
-Great for groups, and for more of a ""dining"" type Chinese buffet experience. 
-Food-wise not the best in its class but still decent; and you can't beat the décor or service (again, versus its competitors that I know of)
-If going with a group, you can ask for separate bills, they are happy to accommodate and are quick.
-At lunchtime, go early, it gets very crowded by noon.

***note: sorry, this is my first review, I should have maybe read the others' before writing this so I apologize in advance for repetition on some items.

Ok, here are my thoughts:
Some background - hadn't visited the website or heard any feedback when I first entered this restaurant. Needless to say I was both surprised and impressed by the magnificent décor. I am not aware of any other Chinese buffet (let alone an authentic one) with any noteworthy décor. I feel this is the restaurant's selling point, over its food so please note I've written more about this than the food itself.

All dark wood, dark (ambient?) lighting. Interesting heavy heavy carved furniture. Seating options for larger groups include long medieval-feeling tables with end chairs looking like throne chairs - super tall backs (fun to hang your jacket on the back and have it high above you); or large oval communal-style dining, all chairs with tall chairback. Medium-sized groups can sit in bench booths, or much more fun - you can sit in a wooden boat, surrounded by blue tiles emulating water. 2-4 parties can sit at round tables (with folding leaves to accommodate more plates and table clutter) or smaller two-seater tables. All seats provide great views of the magnificent dining room. I should note there is a smaller, more modern and bright room as well but the two times I came to this restaurant they were not in use.

Other noteworthy décor notes: 
-there are giant red ornate chandeliers everywhere, bringing together kitsch, recent chandelier trends, but also the Asian love of red. 
-bronze heads of all the Chinese astrological signs great you upon entry.
-strangely, there are glass cabinets displaying jewellery for sale in multiple locations.
-upon entry, you will see large (volleyball-sized) round flour-based and deep-fried balls. These presumably are symbolic for the dragon ""pearl"". It's pretty fascinating to watch staff creating these marvellous wonder in a wok covered in glass for protection from sputtering oil. There are also pieces of broken up balls you can sample on that same counter. They taste like oily sweet cracker chips.

On to the food!

The only contenders I am aware of in similar category are China Buffet King and Starwalk. I won't even count Mandarin (yuck) or anything similar. For me, Both CBK and Starwalk have far superior variety generally speaking. Like its peers, Dragon Pearl has sections for cold salad appetizers, soups, bbq, hot foods, fried foods, dessert, waffle, ice cream. I feel these are similar to peers, but not as good. 

A noteworthy station however is the small easy-to-miss noodle station located by the edible ""pearls"". These are hand-pulled noodles. They are similar to Udon but less chewy. You can choose a broth of either chicken broth, szechuan beef, or chicken something else (a thicker and more flavourful version of the basic chicken broth. These can be topped with green onions and coriander. I've tried the latter two, both excellent. Both times I asked for ridiculous amounts of coriander (I'm an addict) which may have been why I loved these so much but the flavours and textures really were fantastic.

Tea also set this place apart. I ordered Iron Goddess Tea and it was served in a clear glass teapot atop a tea warmer (tealight candle inside). Very much enjoyed having warm tea for the entire meal, and as a plus was fairly good quality tea as well! Far superior over the low-quality versions of Jasmine or Oolong served by its peers.

I wasn't tired after my meal which I usually am after Chinese buffet. Perhaps less/no MSG? 

The meal was polished off with our server bringing us hot towels to wash our hands, and a pile fortune cookies, nice way to end a meal.",6,7eoEh0yu3Pt67nSFASw3ZA

The hotel had really good parking and our stuff was safe in the car overnight. The staff was courteous when we spoke to them and even allowed us to extend our stay an extra night without any hassle. The casino tables are no more outrageously priced that other hotels, and you've got walking access to the other hotels as well.

My friend and I played a few rounds of pool before sitting down to have dinner. We were playing for a few minutes before our waiter got our drink orders. I got a glass of whichever Riesling they had. It was lovely.

When we were ready to eat, I ordered the chicken supreme with garlic mashed potatoes, vegetables in a  chardonnay lemon butter sauce. Wow, was the chicken ever piping hot. Almost burnt my mouth (I was very hungry and excited). It was moist and tender with the right amount of grill marks. The chardonnay lemon butter sauce was amazing. It gave the dish a nice zip. My friend got the chicken souvlaki, but they had run out of tzatziki. When his entrée came, our waiter said they did the best they could and still managed to make a very close tzatziki sauce.

As I attend a few trade shows each year at the convention center across the street the Envy Steakhouse is a life saver as it's a great spot to take clients for a business  lunch in a casual yet classy environment. As those who have done shows at the convention center know the food there is pretty much the standard fast food slop. It's an easy walk over to Envy to enjoy a proper lunch and get off the show floor for a little while. Always good to get re-energized with some decent food before heading back to the grind.

During lunch hours they offer a menu of items from their Grill 55. It's not an overly large menu but has just the right amount to choose from. Comfort food classics mixed in with some American cuisine foods, along with a wine and cocktail selection. Service is very attentive and professional. The food comes out pretty quick. Both times I was here this past week during the Infocomm Show I ordered the Mediterranean Salad - Arugula, Heirloom Tomatoes, Kalamata Olives, 
Bocconcini Mozzarella, Glazed Pistachios, dressed with Local Honey Basil Balsamic Vinaigrette and Grilled Salmon on top. Nice plate of food that was pretty tasty and not gut busting - especially when having to go back to work the convention center!

The European cheese shop is probably one of my favorite places at the market; they have a great selection; I always find myself sampling several different cheeses before deciding on two to three to get.  I also really like Theresa's Bakery, Ohio City Pasta, and several of the meat vendors, one of whom makes a great variety of different sausages.

There's always a great atmosphere at West Side Market, too. (Although, I'll admit, I typically go on days one would expect it to be crowded, like the day before Thanksgiving.)  When I'm there, the place is abuzz with activity.

All in all, West Side Market is just a great place.  I currently reside in D.C. and go to Eastern Market often, and, in terms of selection and size, it doesn't hold a candle to West Side Market!

This is a newer restaurant, taking the spot of the old Pasta Pirate, which was there for years and years. It is clean and inviting. When seated we got shrimp chips and sweet/sour sauce, which was a nice touch.

We had the minced chicken lettuce wrap appetizer, and shared the California fried rice. I had the Miso ramen.  The dipping sauce for the appetizer was good, a tangy sweet taste.  The fried rice was good, but nothing spectacular.  The Miso Ramen was also satisfactory, but nothing to write home about. Looking at the menu again as I write this, I think my problem was in ordering items that are too similar to what I can get at Market Street, or upstairs at Aloha Specialties (kind of hard, given the Hawaiian fares offered at both those places, but possible). But, maybe something different next time. For the quality of the food, it is no better, or not significantly better than Market Street or Aloha Specialties, and, of course, the selection is much more limited here. 

All in all, it's a nice place to dine. A valid option especially when you don't want to wait in line at Market Street or struggle at finding a table at Aloha Specialties.

I had expressed to him that I did not want to use proactive as my skin care (full of chemicals and potentially create wrinkles,etc); however, he insisted that proactive is a good skincare. For my acne treatment, he prescribed me 2 creamers and pills to take (probably full of chemicals which defeats the purpose of me quitting the use of proactive). 

He didn't fully examine my face. He didn't take a good look at my skin. He didn't ask me what my daily routine is. What my diet is. He just came in and was basically like ""so I hear you are having problems with your acne. Here is what I can prescribe you with."" Done. 

He at least told me that my insurance is good so it should cover for the prescriptions. Great! 
Although I was not convinced and was not fully satisfied, I was still content during my first visit here until this happened..

She told me that she sent the prescriptions to Walgreens and that they should give me a call once they're done and THATS when the real problem happened. I never received a call. 

So I called the nearest Walgreens (I didn't even know the exact location bc she didn't tell me) 2 hrs later and they told me that they don't have any prescriptions sent under my name. 

I called the doctors office but the nurses were on a lunch break. I left a message and asked to call back.. they never called back so I called again that day. The nurses were busy. 

Day 2, I called again and the nurses were busy again so I left a message and they told me they would call me back ASAP. That never happened. 

But the specialized pharmacy gave me a call telling me that they have few of my prescriptions but they're not covered by my insurance.... another thing to ask my dermatologist about..

Day 3, I called and they were busy again! So I told them my situation and they said they will email the manager so she can be the one to reach me back. That, of course, never happened so I finally asked when is the best time to call because every time I had called, the nurses were always ""busy"". They told me to call the next day at any time because there is no clients. 

Day 4, I called and asked to talk to the nurse. What did I expect.. they replied back with their usual ""I'm sorry.. the nurses are busy at the moment. Would you like to leave your message so that we can contact you later?"" NO! 

Been calling many times. Never got the call back. Even when I asked for the right time to call, they were always ""busy""

When they realized I was now upset, the nurse FINALLY talked to me. 

For my problem # 1 (walgreens never received the prescriptions and I have no idea which location the ""closest Walgreens"" was) She told me the exact location she sent the prescription to and told me they should have it by now. 

For my problem #2 (my prescriptions were not covered by my insurance), she told me about the replacement she could go ahead and prescribe for me where I can pick it up at the same Walgreens but for the other one, she would have to ask the doctor and that she will give us a call back... of course I never received a call back from them and the replacement prescriptions she sent was ALSO not covered by my insurance and in fact, it was three times more expensive than the original one!! 

After waiting 3 days for them to give me a call back,  I gave up and bought the original one the doctor had prescribed. Yes they were expensive as they were not covered by my insurance but I thought it would be worth it if it could fix my bad acne break out. 

It's been almost a month now and it has actually made my face a lot worse. The stuff he told me to put on my face just really irritated the skin to a point it hurts to even apply water on my face. 

The side effect was really bad so I couldn't apply it on my face that often. & this is where I go back about the doctor not listening to me at all. I told him that I want to avoid chemicals because I have sensitive skin. & he still prescribed me something that potentially is melting my skin off from my face. Once again, he didn't even carefully look at my face or ask about my daily routine.. so that kind of explains the outcome.. 

And the pill.. it makes me so nauseous even after consuming it with food that I've thrown up couple times from taking this pill. I don't think any of these are working and I'm not planning on going back there either. They're just so unprofessional and really unorganized! I feel like the co pay of $80 and the prescribed meds/ointments that costed me around $200 was such a waste!!! 

They were all really nice, I can give them a star for that. But I did not appreciate how they didn't seem to ""care"" about me. If I could have my money back, it would be greatly appreciated. If I could have my skin back, it would be even better. I will definitely be looking for somewhere else where they can give me a better service and provide me the right treatment for MY face and not for ""another client with acne"".",2,PY0UMc96SIToqJ9X1WPyoA

This is a holistic treatment center where I go almost weekly for infrared sauna sessions and/or colonic therapy sessions, with owner Carol Krentzman.
I have never written a review on Yelp prior to this. However, I decided to do so to help others find this wellness center as it has been extremely important in my journey to health this past year.
Carol offers a safe place for people in all stages of their personal journey. I came to In Carol's Care after years of digestive health struggles and multiple surgeries due to juvenile arthritis with subsequent need for multiple pharmaceuticals. In addition, I had recently suffered the devastating death of my mother and was suffering from depression.
I had never done colonic therapy and, like most people, was self-conscious about the idea at first. However, Carol made me feel very comfortable with the procedure and maintained my dignity and privacy throughout. It is a pain free, extremely relaxing procedure that brings not only physical benefits like improved digestion but also mental relaxation. 
I couple the colonic treatments with infrared sauna sessions to improve the detox and relaxation effects. The infrared sauna is also beneficial for decreasing the pain I suffer from arthritis which has allowed me to reduce the number of pharmaceuticals I have taken to an all time low.
Throughout my journey Carol has been a great support not only with her medical guidance but also as a friend. While maintaining a professional approach she always takes time to ask how I'm doing in regards to my orthopedic procedures as well as my grief. Her support has been invaluable.
In regards to value, Carol has often offered me package deals on both services. It is an investment to have colonic treatments but I would argue that the benefits are well worth it. 
I hope more people find this unique, caring treatment center, led by a very knowledgable and empathetic Carol Krentzman.",2,-obm3QwbLrVhwS0K9XQwUg

My coworkers and I ate on a weeknight  - the place was just about empty, which I found suprising since the food turned out to be awesome.

Nice ambiance, while our waiters were knowledgable and efficient and friendly, not a fan of wait staff that aren't cross trained or authorized (?) to handle all requests. 

We tried a bunch of dishes - we started with the olives. Excellent. We then had a meat and cheese platter - the items with their accompaniments were all excellent. We especially liked the chorizo and the country pate.

I ordered the WTF pork chop with spaetzel - solid dish, though the pork chop could have been a bit more juicy. overall the dish was solid. I also tried my coworker's dishes - pumpkin gnochi was delicous as was the ricotta gnocchi with eggplant. My other coworker's ribeye deckle was also delicious, though still not entirely sure what part of the cow is the deckle. Nice to see some interesting cut.

We ordered a side of brussel sprouts which were delicious. Even the people at the table who didn't like brussel sprouts loved them. I swear, brussel sprouts taste much better now than they did when I was a kid. The only dissapointment of the night was the potato fingerlings with horseradish. No heat - just some boring roasted potatoes.

Wine service was solid with a lot of interesting choices.

The ambiance and/or the interiors of the restaurant itself is different from the usual ramen house. From New York, Hong Kong, Philippines, Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Toronto most of the ramen houses that I have been to have wood elements inside - be it walls, tables etc. 

Anyway, going back to the food. I ordered Hakata Ramen (one of the basic ramens that they have), while my husband ordered Miso Ramen. We also ordered Takoyaki on the side. 

1. Hakata Ramen (10.95) - not the typical (strong) pork broth with that certain ""creamy"" taste. It is not salty as well. The serving is really generous (well, for me I suppose). In terms of the pork itself, it's really soft. The owner told us that they did not use any MSG for their ramen, which is good news for all health conscious people! =)

2. Miso Ramen ($7.95) - my husband liked it! I trust his opinion 'coz he's a good cook. The serving is smaller than the Hakata one.  

3. Takoyaki ($6.95) - First of all, I want to say that it does not taste nor smell ""fishy"" at all.  I am kind of specific with the smell because sometimes it makes my appetite turn. There are 6 balls per serving, which is kind of fair ... and the size is just right. Perfect for one big bite =) The sauce on top of it was also commendable - i like it! Although I must mention that the size of the octopus inside the ball was kind of small. 

Addition:
We received a complementary dessert from the restaurant, they call it DORAYAKI. It's kind of like a pancake with filling (if I remember it right ... it has chickpeas with fine matcha powder). To be honest, I really don't eat peas in general ... but this dessert was just too good to say ""pass."" I can finally say, ""Chickpeas virgin no more.""

Service. Although we had to seat ourselves because the server at that time was attending to something ... I can still say that I like their service. The owner/server was really good in communicating - she can even discuss the ingredients of your food and at the same time, make recommendations. 

Overall, lovely experience!

Hope this review can help =)",2,v79FIW2u1CinM47iE2OYpg

The food: It was delicious with only one (tiny) issue. We had the tomato bread (because you have to) with the Ham Platter (Seleccion de embutidos) which included Iberico ham, Serrano and a spicy salami - which was amazeballs. Totally brought back memories of Barcelona tapas bars.

I also can't say enough about the 'Pimientos Rellenos de buey' (Piquillo peppers stuffed with braised oxtail and Manchego cheese) - rich, decadent, delicious and perfectly paired with the wine we were drinking. The wine was from the Ribera Del Duero region, called 'Avaniel' - highly recommended.

We also had their Fideo pasta special - with  shrimp, summer vegetables, soffrito 'sauce' and aioli. It was delicious - except that the shrimp were a tad overcooked (sorry Chef!). They could have stood to be cooked about a minute or two less than they were (or maybe it was a heat lamp issue).

At one of my last appointments I saw a new, young dentist I had never seen before.  Within 30 seconds I was told I had a ""watch spot"" and that I needed to come back to have it filled.  I haven't had a cavity since I was a kid, but my memory of it was that my tooth had a small amount of pain and I pretty much knew that there was a cavity before the dentist even told me.  This time around, I had been experiencing no pain whatsoever so it caught me off guard. For those who don't know what a watch spot is, it is basically not even a cavity yet.  The funny thing is, he was looking at x-rays that were 6 months old.  When the x-rays were initially taken, the dentist that saw me then said my teeth looked perfect. I was not convinced so I waited another 6 months.  At my subsequent appointment, I saw the same dentist and was again told I needed to have the tooth fixed despite the fact that I still felt no pain in that tooth.  So, I reluctantly made the appointment to have the ""watch spot"" filled.  It has been months and I have been in constant pain since then.  Sometimes it is pain from sensitivity to hot/cold, sometimes it is pain when I bite down on it, and sometimes I cannot figure out why it is hurting, but it radiates throughout the entire side of my jaw and up into my ear.  When speaking with some friends' parents who are retired dentists, I was told to watch out for this new generation of dentists.  They like to find all kinds of ""problems"" to either pay for their new expensive equipment or increase the profitability of the practice (especially if you have dental insurance).  To add insult to injury, I saw photos on their Facebook page that included an office ""team building"" trip to the Hard Rock in Punta Cana.  There were at least a dozen people on the trip.  I had recently been to that resort and know for a fact it is not cheap...cost $500/night for two of us.  I'm just wondering if my sudden dental problems helped pay for the trip.",3,0XYnUac0Q5UMnKmLiXDswQ

And just to say, we only came here because it was 3pm and The Local was not open until 5pm.

From the moment we stepped in I could tell the waitress was unhappy with her miserable life, or something. She kept texting on her phone and not paying attention to us even being there... (It was not busy, maybe our table and 3 others) When she FINALLY got up off her butt to come serve us, her arms were crossed in a very closed off and unfriendly manner, as she asked what she could get us. My friend asked for a drink menu in which case the waitress said ""we don't have one"" and looked away from her.. Not even mentioning what she had on tap, what she could get us instead... she just closed off the conversation completely. When we finally ordered, (it was like pulling teeth to get her to tell us what was on tap...) I had the burger which wasn't so terrible. But my friend had a cajun wrap which was absolutely disgusting. There was too much seasoning. It was like biting into a giant grain of salt. By this point I noticed my friend wasn't eating. I tried to get the waitress' attention but she was in her own little world.  She had only come back once to refill my friends boyfriends drink and left mine and my friends drinks empty for an hour, without the mention of a refill... and without her coming over to take my friends complaint to fix her food. She was too busy texting.

Needless to say after an hour of waiting... We put our plates and my friends unfinished plate of food on the bar for her to take away (When she was ready of course) And went to grab beers somewhere else.

Within, it contains the best Mexican food that I've had anywhere. Most places that I eat, I wonder, why is this or this even on the plate, it's unpalatable and excessive. Jalisco is the place where my wife and I literally eat all of the sauce, every drop of food and liquid on the plate. Everything tastes homemade and delicious. It it never crowded and always provides great food and quick service. We have easily eaten here over 30 times and this is our go to place when we expect a great and affordable meal. Our total ticket price for two people is usually $20 or less. I'm very happy this place is not located in Phoenix or anywhere popular as I enjoy have a private spot that no one seems to know about. 

The fish tacos are the way fish tacos should taste. Tasty, fresh, crunchy, with a midly spicy sauce that is to die for. The enchiladas have the best sauce we have ever tasted. I am not exaggerating when I say that we eat the sauce by the spoonful. My only tiny gripe is that the drink sizes are small, but hey, this is a good place to be if that's my only complaint. 

I've had meals all over Arizona from the cheapest fast food to expensive $200 per person dinners. This Mexican place puts to shame restaurants that routinely charge $30 and up per person.

We were running in a bit late and sped through the parking area to find a good spot. By now, it was only 5 minutes left before the show would start and we had a feeling that we wouldn't get there in time, especially if we were to run in our heels.

Thankfully enough, we were greeted by a little express car ride (is there a term for these?) as we came out of the parking doors, hopped on and were zoomed to Reynolds Hall where the show began the moment we sat down. 

Considering I've been waiting 9 years to watch this show since it debuted in 2003, I was blown away by the production. The hall was packed and there wasn't an empty seat in sight. Sound and singers were pitch perfect. The orchestra didn't miss a single beat, or a note for that matter. Everything went about smoothly and it took me about a week to get over the experience. 

The smith center is the cultural 'district' we've all been waiting to have here in Vegas and sure as anything, we couldn't be happier that it's got its schedule lined up well with jazz artists and broadway musicals etc. all throughout the year.

I'm thinking when we got there and there wasn't anyone there she would be happy to have the business. We were a relatively easy group, nothing difficult. We were also here for our very first visit. Some say that the food was better and they preferred it over Angry Crab, others disagreed. I don't eat seafood so I can't weigh in other than to say I had the chicken strips. They were ok. I guess if I had to say, they were better than the non-seafood at Angry Crab. Angry Crab has terrible BBQ and bad burgers for those who don't eat seafood. At least the chicken here was edible.

If you read nothing else in this review, there are 3 words every Unique shopper should memorize - ""Half Price Mondays.""  Yes, on Mondays, everything in the store is 1/2 price.  You WILL be joined by every other
savvy bargain-shopper, the working poor, single mom's with screaming kids, and others from the fabric of Cleveland life.  It is worth it.  Trust me.

Having grown up right around the corner, when I was in high school, I indulged my mid - 1980s John Hughes inspired hipster self perception by buying a couple dozen, vintage cardigan sweaters.  REALLY nice cardigan sweaters that I am sure came from some old man's closet once he passed away.  As I grew older, I passed those cardigans along to other thrift stores in Boston, New Haven, Chicago and Denver ... but as I edge ever closer to ""old man-hood"" myself, I wish I had some of those vintage 1960's, pure wool cardigans again. 

I, myself, have a fetish for old kitchen implements and have always found Unique (this one and the one on West 25th) to be a complete treasure trove - the Le Creuset steamer I have in my kitchen (purchased for $1. 10  on 1/2 price Monday - Google ""Le Creuset"" to get a sense of the bargain on this one) is testament to that.  

When I lived in Cleveland and had guests visit, a Monday tour of the W. 25th and Fulton Uniques was always scheduled.  Out of town friends were always amazed at the things they found.  You can also feel good that you are keeping things out of landfills and supporting a charitable organization.  And - of course - finding unique, interesting items that will elicit gasps from your hipster friends when they ask ""OH. MY. GOD.  Where did you find THAT.  It's so cool.""  And you can reply, with a small, secretive smile: ""Oh, just some little speciality shop down near Tremont.  It's a one-of-a-kind, you know.""",4,WUb8KUdRjdOzA2TVNke9Ow

We decided to try the club and their website should have been our first warning.  It's in french only and poorly designed with a greater concern about renting out rooms than informing anyone about the fees to enter.  We went on a Saturday night just to try the place and it cost us $70 which was $50 for the night plus an additional $20 for a mandatory membership card that is good for only 1 night.

The only good thing I can say about the place is that it was clean.  However I think the Party Quebecois Separatist was having a meeting the night we went and we just got treated like shit by so many people.  We ended up hooking up with a German couple and when we started to have sex all of a sudden everyone that treated us like garbage became interested in us.  Or to be more exact it was the men that became interested in my girlfriend. 

Some of the men just started fondling my girlfriend without asking or even bothering to say hello. One guy put on a rubber and proceeded to try and help himself to the German lady but she put a stop to that.

We not only love the ambiance but the lunch menu is nice and the portions were large.  I can understand the 2 star review recently for the escargot because, in all honesty, it wasn't classic.  It was more of a deconstructed version and most people aren't into that, I guess.  Anyway, on to the food.

The food was outstanding, from the burger and fries to their sea bass, and up to the souffle.  We had the following:

Course 1 : Escargot - okay, I get it.  Like I said, it's  deconstructed version with lots of thinly sliced garlic pieces, diced tomatoes, wine and cream sauce with a bit of butter.  The flavors were very bold and a bit too much for my taste.  

Course 2: Lobster bisque - this is what a real bisque is.  There's a fine line between chowder and bisque texture, and theirs is smooth, not too creamy and not too watery, and the flavor of lobster is strong.  There's a bit of liquor as well, which was nice, and the drizzle of marscapone with a chunk of lobster meat was wonderful.  I loved every drop.

Main Courses: Their burger with fries was wonderfully juicy, large, and yummy.  The meat was seasoned well, and the aioli was a nice touch.  Fries were crispy and not oily.  The sea bass was beautiful, with a crispy skin, which is what we look for, and perfectly flaky meat.  The bed of veggies was a bonus.

Dessert: Souffle - yum.  Fluffy, creamy, and hot out of the oven.  You can't go wrong with chocolate anything, really.

Price: under 80 dollars.  Fabulous.

If you've been to the Joe's real BBQ in old town Gilbert, then you know the setup here, grab your food and choose to eat inside or outside in the family friendly open-air 'back yard'. I prefer the latter, built out of an old farmhouse (I understand it was the owner's childhood home) there lots of mature trees, green grass, not to mention the small working farm behind the restaurant really helps to  transport you back to a time when this area wasn't a sea of cookie-cutter homes and Walgreen's on ever corner. 

Enough about the place, what about the food. I'd say if you're looking for BBQ go to Old town, they have it here, and it's good, but it's not the same.

This is one of those ""you have to experience it for yourself"" type of places.  Five stars doesn't even scratch the surface of what type of service and accommodations you will receive when you spend your day here.  My mom and I decided to spend a full day and sample as much as we could possibly fit in... with some downtime in between services.  Booking appointments with the concierge - wonderful, informative, and top notch.  Arrive and check-in - fabulous.  This is the only spa I have been to where they have you complete a full health intake form - VERY MUCH appreciated.  All while you enjoy delicious hot tea, a cool cloth, and the removal of your shoes to be replaced with spa sandals.  The spa attendants were WONDERFUL and incredibly attentive.  Fresh tea, cold water, explanations of the facility... very thorough.

Mom and I started with the day with a Hammam treatment.  What a delight for the senses.  Firm, soft, hot, cold, warm... One of the most incredible treatments I have ever experienced.  I couldn't stop touching my legs for two days after - I was so silky, it was insane.  If you do ONE thing at The Spa - try the Hammam.  A total delight for the senses.

The Jade Enzyme facial was incredible and relaxing.  The Detox Foot Treatment was also incredible.  All of it.  Amazing.  I didn't even get to excessively use the facilities as I had originally intended... next time.  I spent most of my time relaxing on the warmed tiled loungers overlooking LV Boulevard or nestled up in the cozy beds in the relaxation room with a cup of hot tea and a bottle of ice water.

Next time I go back, I will be booking the Time Ritual... two hours and fifty minutes of treatments customized specifically for my body's needs that day?  Oh heck yes!  Scrub me, rub me, make me melt!  I cannot wait to return!

As for the prices and the three lines of tips... get over it and show the people that make this place so wonderful a little respect... or don't come here for service.  These folks are working at one of the, if not THE best spa in Vegas and certainly command the prices that you will pay.  They are working very hard to make sure that you get your money's worth and I am a firm believer in gratuity that is commensurate with that effort.  So if you get a little sticker shock... head up strip to a different spa.  Tip rant off.

All in all and magical experience.  Worth every dollar and then some.  Looking forward to going back in a few months and trying a few different services.

If you don't want to valet, park in the Aria self-park and walk over to the Mandarin.  It is a surprisingly short and easy walk... when you arrive at the hotel, you take the elevator to the 23rd floor and then take the guest elevators down to the 8th floor.  It is a bit of an adventure, but plan for a little extra time just in case.  The hotel itself is also gorgeous and I hear that their high tea in their tea lounge is not to be missed.

Nathan F. was the plumber assigned to our job, and he proved very competent in what he did. While my husband was able to get the pilot re-lit, it would shut off after a few minutes. Nathan removed the burner assembly and vacuumed the area out with his shop-vac. Replaced the assembly, and re-lit pilot that stayed on, and on!!! Really appreciate that Nathan stayed for about 15-20 minutes after the re-light, as I was afraid he would leave, and then the pilot would again go out. Service call- diagnosis and resolution came to about $106 which I find very reasonable. 30 day warranty... Will certainly call Christian Brothers again for our next plumbing need (although I hope it's not anytime soon!).

Also want to mention how much I appreciated Ty, the dispatcher's honesty. When I called on Saturday, he said we would be on stand-by in case someone cancelled; otherwise, someone would be out on Sunday between 1:00-4:00.

First of all, you get $3 off for checking in to Yelp which is a huge plus in my book. Great move by the owner. The parking is a little sparse, but we managed to get a good spot with minimal line. They have a great selection of BBQ from both fatty and lean brisket, to their signature sandwich the Texas Po Boy. The prices were consistent with other BBQ joints.

I ordered the Texas Po Boy because it covered the main types of food you're looking for: brisket, pulled pork and sausage. This sandwich is huge and comes with plenty of meat. I'd suggest it if you're coming hungry and ready to eat. It was quite tasty for every bite. The down side for me was that the sausage tended to overpower the other meats, which makes sense due to the strength of sausage flavor as a whole. I also wish they had their own BBQ sauce selection for customers. I was not a fan of the BBQ sauce they put on the sandwich for you. I would have liked to add my own, and had options like you do at other places. If you're getting brisket, I would recommend getting the lean. My friend had the ""moist"" brisket and it had a little too much fat on it. That was coming from a guy who loves fatty brisket.

2. Decide to open a Brewery (Check)
That's it folks that all that is needed guys are simple so this rule applies to opening a bar or starting a band etc. Now it helped the guys who opened this place worked in a brewery and were recently laid off from work. 
The location is pretty amazing as its located right next to the Rogers and Metro Toronto Convention Center i.e. I bet that results in automatic clientele kudos to the owners on picking this spot.
I came here for a tour of the brewery (though it helped it was a hot day and I was looking for a cold one). The tour starts with a sample of the beer (now why don't all tours start like that is beyond me!) and one is given a bottle of beer midway through the tour (I bet they came up with that idea too when they were drunk) so kudos for that. The tour itself is nothing special as one just get to walk around the brewery and listen to mundane stuff. Though I commend the brewery for their keeping it green initiative. 
The event space is quite nice and I can see it being a good place to host events.

For me, this establishment has done something that very, very few have done before. It gave me a feeling of satisfaction with my sushi. To me, sushi is a type of cuisine based around sticky rice that often involves raw fish. I believe it should be painstakingly prepared by masters with simple yet amazing flavor and design.

While I tried to stay away from their original rolls, the traditional sashimi was expertly prepared. The big bowl udon was fantastic and had all of the old-school additions that remind me of home (I'm chinese by the way.) The beef tataki had good flavor and a good grill on the edges with a nice balanced dipping sauce. The sushi and sashimi assortment dinner is a most-try for those who are new to this type of cuisine.

The staff here insured every glass was always full of your chosen non-alcoholic beverage. They kept every bottle of sauce full as well with even the smallest amount used to be replaced immediately.

However, there were problems with the food today. 

Toshi's specialty is aburisushi. I had the hotate scallops which come as two pieces and Pacific roll. The fish was good and was slightly seared. Aburisushi is rare but strangely, the aburi is not on the menu. It is only advertised on a sheet of paper at the entrance.

We ordered the saba battera and the waitress informed us that they were missing a key ingredient, konbu, which is the thin slice of seaweed that covers it. We persisted and it was good, but clearly missing the konbu of course. The nigiri sushi itself good, but not very good. Frankly, the rice was too hard. The sushi rice needs to be softer.

All in all then, a few missed today, but still they have a wide and authentic offering and are still above average for sushi.However, I believe that given the area and demands of the customer base Toshi may have been swayed by the pull of clientele who wants inauthentic items like Vulcano roll or spicy this and spicy that.

The owner is Japanese, but the waitress and second chef were speaking to each other in Chinese.

Finally, they have created a nice atmosphere with Japanese decorations, lanterns, boys and girls' festival dolls and zodiac figurines. Nice job which lends itself to an authentic setting, but too bad that they have a TV hanging from the roof, which is never a good sign for food. The washrooms were clean which is important and a good sign.",0,cBg8LzT-bxt5uO9Jh9icdA

I went again last week for some casual drinks with some friends, it's usually a pretty busy atmosphere so come a bit early if you want to secure seats, especially if you're coming in a group. We were short a couple seats so some of us had to stand and it was a bit squishy and it seemed we were always in a lane of traffic, nonetheless we made it work and enjoyed the evening.

One of my biggest draws to 1410 is they have a solid beer selection with some unique choices you don't find at many other places. Once again this was the case as I ordered ""Fire and Blood"" the Game of Thrones themed beer, very cool to see unique selections like this! They have much more including mini-yards, boots, etc. Another great plus is their specials are usually a decent premium beer, not the usual cheap domestic special you find elsewhere; it was Delirium on special in this instance. One thing I will mention is that the beers are priced higher than your usual domestic choices, more of a $7-9 beer place and not a $5-6 beer.

Our server Justine was very on point and accommodating, she even went as far to learn the group's names to make the experience more personable. Very nice touch that I rarely see anymore. Maybe she was a tad too flirty and pushy with drinks; I get that it usually helps with sales and tips but for me personally it wasn't necessary. Especially since a member in our group really should not have been offered any more to drink. That's just me over-critiquing though, overall great service, very satisfied! 

They had a live DJ which is a nice touch, just wasn't feeling the playlist much other than a couple good throw backs.

One thing that we didn't get to experience on this particular night but is definitely worth checking out is their roof top patio. I got to scope it out last summer and was very happy!

Regardless, the pedi was horrible.  Toes were cut unevenly, I had polish on the skin, and it was overall, the worst pedi of my life, and for a price that is WAY over the competition in the area.

On one hand, the fish taco was amazing, but the regular soft tacos were less than appealing. Not to mention, the 35 min wait which you'd hope that the reward would be an amazing meal, but we were less than satisfied. 

It's located at Baldwin and Augusta, on the upper floor. There's a few picnic tables for communal eating and a window seating for people watching. There's also a piano for decoration but seems to not really play any other function - could fit more seats. 

As we were waiting there, it was quite noticeable that there was no sense of excitement or energy. It could be that it's that the majority of people were just waiting for their meals. 

If you're not savvy with Mexican food, all the names might be overwhelming, but the staff there are nice and are patient enough to explain them to you.

You have your tacos (a soft tortilla) or ""soft tacos"" (smaller $6 for 2) with a corn tortilla.  You can also make any one of these flavours a burrito - chicken, beef barbacoa, pork, veggie.  There's also empanadas and tostadas with creviche. Also Tamales (which I've never tried before til today) among other things. 

They also have gluten free shells for all of their tacos, so I requested it, but they just plain forgot when it finally came time to make my meal (at least 20-30 mins later) 

We ordered the fish taco, which was filled with some sort of coleslaw, cream sauce and guac. Aside from the fact the tortilla was not crispy and the entire thing ended up being soggy (waiting for 10 mins while my friend's taco was being prepared) - it was very tasty. 

We also got two soft tacos, double wrapped in tortilla (not sure why) which ended up with a filling vs shell ratio that was less than desired.  The filling inside wasn't hot either, and tasted a little bland over all. 

We also got a tamale, more out of curiosity.  It was wrapped in a Banana Leaf, then steamed (then microwaved to heat up before giving it to us). I quite liked it, but not sure if you can call it a speciality. 

Let's cut them some slack, because they just opened, and still trying to figure things out, but unfortunately the food isn't up to a certain standard either.",4,0BBUmH7Krcax1RZgbH4fSA

Their location is incredibly apropos to the food, mostly starring sambal and curry dishes.  The lunch sets are very reasonably priced, and ~$9 will get you a curry and rice.  The hubs and I always go for the beef brisket curry, which is a thick dark yellow curry with stewed beef brisket and potato chunks, plus a dish of sambal shrimp with some onion slices mixed together.  Tom yum gong soup is on the watery side, spiked with a few mushroom slices and tomato cubes.  A set dinner for two (your choice of two entrees from a list, two carb servings of choice - you'll need to pay extra for chicken oil rice, coconut rice, or roti - plus two desserts, usually of the Chinese warm sweets variety) is priced at $30.

I think I'm mostly just disappointed because they used really generous with their spices and coconut milk at their old location years ago, but having changed chefs together with inflation of ingredient costs has hit them hard.  Roti is rather expensive at $3 for a small serving the size of an tea plate.

All in all, I'd come here to grab a simple and quick meal, but not to particularly savour the cuisine.

Right across from Summerhill Station is the best salon you didn't even know about: The Alcorn! When you walk in, the all white interior is complemented by stunning fashion photography featuring owner Tony Masciangelo's work. I also love the big wooden table on the upstairs floor. Make sure you get a tour. Staff are welcoming and professional. 

THE GOODS 
This is the place where fashion editors get their hair done and I was in good hands with Jed for my highlights. My rusty roots had taken its toll and Jed freshened em right up so they looked as golden as new. Jed is super talkative and friendly and I'd go back just to have a chat with him. I know a lot of people who rave about Tony's cuts but I haven't had the pleasure yet. 

Bonus: he now follows me on instagram. Does your salon follow you on instagram? :) 

Compared to other salons in Yorkville, the prices for highlights are really reasonable.

I needed a u-haul truck to transport the remainder of items out my house which btw I needed to have out the house that day. I go to customer service and speak with one lady about renting a truck overnight. First she said that she didn't think they did overnight renting and it was almost closing time so I wouldn't be able to get one that day for the use of same day. She was uncertain whether they did overnight because of some recent things that had occurred. She spoke with the Assistant manager over the phone who told her that she could go ahead and rent me an overnight vehicle. I went back to my car to let my boyfriend know what was going on. As I returned into the store the lady I had been dealing with sent me over to another cashier to take care of this. This new lady has no clue about what I needed assistance with and has to ask the lady who sent me to her. While they are talking things over they then start doubting whether it will be okay to rent me the van and the new lady calls someone ( the assistant manager ) who comes to front right away and now says they will not be renting me the vehicle for overnight due to a recent situation that happen with one of the vehicles. I got really pissed off because the assistant manager switched up his decision and I had waisted valuable time there walking away without a truck. It basically was up to the assistant manager to decide if he wanted to allow a truck being rented for overnight. When the first cashier called him he should not have told her it was okay to rent me the truck for overnight. That particular location will never get my business again. They were all a bunch of....

I'm not sure if it's the almonds, the crunchy sugar bits, or the custard intermingled with cake, but the combo is a delightful treat. However, beware the other burnt almond tort items just aren't as good as the original. 

Burnt Almond Torte Bar - this is shaped like a log. It's the perfect combo.

Burnt Almond Torte Cookie - it's crispy but lacks the custard feel.

Burnt Almond Torte Cake - we were advised to buy the cake when I asked to walk away with 4 bars. The cake was good but the ratio of ingredients is off. The middle of the cake lacks the crunchies that you get with the bar.

Walking Burnt Almond Torte - this is the newest concept. I'm not sure if I just got an old one. It was the last one in the fridge advertising for these new tortes in a cup. It's pretty much a dry, stale parfait. The layers are packed super tightly into a cup. You have to dig through what seems like an endless clump of cake before you get to custard. It's a miss. Stick to the bar.

The only other Burnt Almond Torte item left is the cupcake. I haven't tried it yet. It looks great with a generous dollop of custard. This item should be a winner but if you want a guarantee pick the bar.

I've also tried their cheesecake which is typical of your standard NY cheesecake. It's simple, solid cheesecake option. No frills solid bakery.

I live pretty close by so i go their often for lunch when i'm to lazy to cook for myself or i go when my family wants to go as well.

I suggest going with a group but going with a group or family around peak hours (lunch and dinner) as it may feel a little awkward eating alone but out side of that its pretty quiet there.

I really enjoy the service as the waitresses are very friendly, food portions are pretty huge and tastes great. prices seem pretty fair and if you bring friends to split the bills on side dishes its even better!

My favourite thing to get is the Jajang myun (black bean noodles) tang soo yuuk (sweet and salty sauce on deep fried pork strips)  split bowls. they have combo deals with sides and main dishes for groups and stuff also so i suggest that when you in groups! They also do take out so you can bring the food home and eat it!

Prices are a bit higher compared to other locations and meals don't come with soup and drinks. For this prime real estate a few minutes from Dundas Square, it makes sense. 

I did not notice a difference in quality from food here to what you can find in Markham. On this visit we ordered the hainanese chicken and baked chicken steak with black pepper sauce. 

Hainanese chicken: chicken was really well cooked, had the a nice soft texture and rice was very flavourful. I really enjoyed the 2 sauces that came along with the dish. 

Chicken steak: huge portions and very well cooked. Black pepper sauce was a bit on the peppery side and lacked some acidity.

Heard they were charging $10 for entry (even if you were a guest staying at the hotel), was not charged once, then, they said they charged $10 on Saturdays if they have a special guests, still was not charged on Saturday.  Free.  

DJ played great music throughout the day, people complain about not getting a lounge chair, whatever, plenty of spots to put your stuff down, rather be in the water when it's 110 out.  But again, people complain about everything.  I am part of the second wave, meaning, our group arrived around 1-130p, didn't wait long until the first wave of people began to leave, if you keep your eyes open you can spot someone leaving and snag up their lounge chair.  

Drinks are $$, but you should expect that when you are in Vegas, but if you're smart, you'll pregame hard in your room so that you wont have to buy tons of alcohol at the pool, remember, nothing is cheap, food however is reasonable.  Their loaded nacho is only $11; it will fill up a group of people.  Plenty of spots to get drinks, Friday and Saturday they host their booty shaking contest, which is entertaining!  Towels provided to all guest.

The cocktails at Bar Raval were delicious. The appetizers and tapas were not bad, but a bit pricey for the quality and portions you are getting.

Especially coming from Los Angeles where I don't often experience rain, it was great to come here to listen, feel, and watch it rain!  The show starts out with fog and colored lights and is accompanied by lightning as the rain falls from the sky, I mean, ceiling!  It's fun to watch and is a free experience.

Show times are: Mon-Thur, top of each hour from 10:00AM to 11:00PM; Fri-Sun, every half hour from 10:00AM to 11:00PM

I think it is not possible to get drenched, but you will feel sprinkles if you stand close to the ropes.  Be careful walking by the area because the nearby flooring might be slippery.

I had no idea, but I read this, ""Before it became Planet Hollywood, this building was the Aladdin and the shopping mall was the Desert Passage"".  The rainstorm was a leftover feature from Aladdin.  I'm glad this is still an attraction!

The entire staff is pleasant to deal with as well. The front desk ladies always serve you with a smile and the assistants (Angela specifically) are always ready to help you with whichever treatment needs to be done.

My family ate here a week ago. It was a Friday night, busy, but not horrible. We were greeted and seated right away. It was at least 15 minutes before the server (a male, didn't get his name) came and took our drink orders, then it was another 15 minutes before our drinks began to arrive at the table! They arrived one at a time. We tried to order beer but were told they didn't have any because the cooler was broke. My husband ordered a margarita, which arrived first..then my son's sprite came out about 6 minutes later. My bloody mary?? 23 minutes after I ordered! 
The Food - my husband ordered the prime rib sandwich, I ordered the Steak Diane burger and my son had chicken. All of the food was delicious and prepared perfectly. I've been craving the Steak Diane burger since that night. The presentation of the food was beautiful and we'd all order the same meals again. 
We used to be regulars at the owner's previous spot and want to support a local restaurant. The food is worth going back for. The only reason I'm not rating 5 stars is for lack of service. Once the server dropped off our drinks, he didn't return to our table until 1 hour and 16 minutes later to drop off the check. We had to ask two others that were working that night for more water and sprite. We will definitely be back...but will be hopeful our server will be better prepared.",2,2yJORbHcXd43VzgxbC9K0g

Quince's semi annual Indonesian Rijsttafel ($55/person) that I experienced on September 28th, 2001 was such a treat!

What is Rijsttafel? I even have problem pronouncing it.  It is a Dutch word that literally translates to ""rice table"", is an elaborate meal adapted by the Dutch from the Indonesian feast called nasi padang.*

Rijsttafels strive to feature an array of not only flavors and colors and degrees of spiciness but also textures, an aspect that is not commonly discussed in Western food. Such textures may include crispy, chewy, slippery, soft, hard, velvety, gelatinous, and runny.*

I was intrigued when I saw the menu. My Yelp Friend even taken back and asked the waiter if we need to choose from the given menu. Our friendly waiter just asked us to relax, no decisions need to be made as every single item list on the menu would be served to us!! That's what I call a feast!!! A food adventure!

So much food... a steady parade of little dishes were served to us the whole evening. Some are good, Some are so so, Some are meh. But it was the concept, the experience, the atmosphere I enjoyed here at Quince that made this evening memorable.

I was so overdosed with food by the 2nd round of the rice table, ended up packing enough for lunch for 2 people the next day. And the food surprising tasted even better after I heated it up in the microwave!

Thanks Quince for putting together this special Indonesian Rijsttafel feast! It was such a real culinary adventure!

Both came in completely too big or too small. To me it seemed to be an obvious up sell for alterations as it was mentioned 10+ times in conversation. ( I understand some dresses need alterations most the time, but these were WAY off!! ) just a tactic to make a bigger profit off of you. My mother in law was close to tears the day she went in to try on her dress. Vicki had the ""oh well"" attitude and jumped right to saying no returns or refunds. To make the situation, worse she spoke over us and was not listening to my mother in laws needs or to hear how truly disappointed she was. Horrible experience.

When I got the call from my Mom that this was happening, I panicked. ""Hospice care"" was always synonymous with imminent death to me (not the case with ALZ patients) and I was in PHX with my hubby who is awaiting a heart transplant. Well, while Hospice is not at all a happy word, the care my Father and Mother receive 24/7 is nothing short of inspiring: he is living with dignity, and Mom receives outstanding support as a caregiver. 

They had an initial consultation with a caseworker, who ordered all of the necessary supplies to set up my Dad to be comfortable in his own home, which both my parents wanted. Now their caseworker, Kara, and Nurse, Pam, each visit once weekly to order any supplies or meds needed; volunteers check in regularly by phone; and I've personally witnessed an Emergency Nurse come at 1AM, talk to a Dr, and have pain medication delivered to the door within the hour. They've even coordinated with my folks' church to have Nuns administer communion to them weekly. 

In July, they facilitated inpatient Respite care for five days - with transportation to and from - so Mom could visit PHX to celebrate a very special occasion, shop, bond, and rest. Mom calls them her ""angels"" and I must agree. I've been in LV with them since just before New Year's Eve, and though it will be painful to leave them and return to PHX due to separation anxiety, I couldn't imagine better care for them, anywhere. 

As we navigate the unfamiliar territory of end-stage Alzheimer's, we are forever grateful for these ""Angels"" met along the path. It takes a special person to do this type of work, and every single NAH employee or volunteer we have interacted with has been absolutely incredible. Finally, Nathan Adelson is a 501C3 non-profit organization: all of the above and more is free-of-charge to patients; they frequently hold fundraisers in the community,  and are worth a look for charitable giving.

Since moving to the Charlotte area in june 2015, this has hands down become my favorite place to get a great burger. I've been here approx 6 times in the last 6 months, most recently a few days ago. I've never received bad service or my order wrong or improperly cooked meal. It's a bar/pub/tavern experience so it is noisy, but the food and people are great and it features sports on tv, a pool table, and skee ball which my kid loves. There is also a huge outdoor seating area when temps are milder. Very ample food options for the kids too.",0,r5CDhY4y53oppe7CMsHStQ

With the 2012 Summer season approaching I was reminiscing about last years pools I've visited.  The Blvd Pool was one but this was more of a relaxed atmosphere.  You don't usually go crazy and rage here unless of course you attend an event or concert.  The nice fuzzy blue chairs lined up in front of the TV is so relaxing, and so easy to fall asleep on.  There's a kiddy pool to the left, also manned by a lifeguard.  

The staff here is nice and attentive.  You also have a bar that's stocked and when you smell the armoa of food in the air you'll also want a bite to eat.  There's a warm jacuzzi area and the main pool area and a deep end within that.  There are lots of chairs around but they are occupied with quickly.  And the view from this area is nice.  This is too relaxing for me though.

I had no problems going in to the pool area to relax, no cost and no checking of room keys.  I don't know if that policy has sinced changed though.",3,k4M43lXJuQMpQW65DTqzIQ

Let me preface this by saying that I give out five star ratings more sparingly since learning what very high quality food tastes like vis-a-vis Andre's in Vegas, (see my review on that if you are ever down there)  This however is up to par.  Their potatoes are cooked in duck fat, so they are not always the most vegetarian friendly, but they have options to keep vegetarians like my fiancé happy.  She had a truffled squash Benedict.  They shaved real black truffle (as opposed to Chinese truffles that are sometimes passed off as black truffles,) into her squash, and she very much enjoyed it.  I had a Gold Digga box that also had a lot of truffle shavings in it, along with pork belly, home fries that taste like confit, (by the way, they also have duck confit, or properly, confit de canard. as they are fried in duck fat ergo extra delicious.  There was also an interesting and flavourful cheese, the name of which unfortunately slips my mind.  The portions are fairly large, so go there hungry.  I was glad it all came in a box, so I could just pack it up and go home.  Also, the fruit plate had some very fresh fruit, even a dragon fruit.  This is certainly not standard breakfast fare.

The menu is interesting in that this is a japanese fusion place so they have everything from ramen to waffles with bulgogi, I like interesting, hence the excitement, unfortunately where it really mattered they were lacking.
We started with the braised pork belly slices, I was so excited and consequently somewhat let down. The flavor was good, not great but good, I prefer my pork belly a little crisp, here, the meat was soooo tender you can barely pick it up.. there was sauce and meat chucks everywhere.. lol I thought it was just me but noted that several others who tried the dish also had the same issue. 
I finished with sesame tonk ramen and this is where my sadness really crept in. I like my ramen savory, hot and tasty.. here it was... bleh, warm and needed more flavor. The seaweed while good overwhelmed the dish which was disappointing because that is primarily all I could taste.

Once I took the car home within a week the check engine light turned on and when I took it to their service department I was treated really badly by their used car service manager but they fixed the fuel injectors which was weird but ok. For the next three weeks the check engine light would turn on and off driving me crazy and when I finally took the car with the light on, they kept me waiting for 25 minutes being cryptic asking all kinds of questions and finally I was told the car had a bad transmission and they wouldn't fix it because I didn't buy extended warranty which was never offered to me. When I was told by the sales manager Antonio that the transmission was bad and they wouldn't fix it, he said to me we are just going to take the car back buy it back and you can go somewhere else to buy a car and kicked me out of the dealership! He wouldn't even offer to put me in another used car or anything. He had already called his driver by the time he talked to me and he also said to me that when the car left their lot the transmission was ok and that in the whole month that I had the car and drove it less than 200 miles I broke the transmission somehow!! To say I will never go back to this dealership is not enough!! They ruined my credit as I am still getting letters from banks. I was also lied to and told that capital one wanted 4500 down payment when I called capital one they said that was a lie they had only asked for 500 down and a newer car.

Our party of four arrived about 12 minutes early for our reservation.  In a preachy, scolding tone, the hostess said the restaurant did not seat parties before the time of the reservation, and that we could wait at the entrance or go to the bar.   As we passed through the dining room to the bar, we noticed many vacant tables.  If it's the restaurant's policy not to seat till the exact time, fine, but there's a better way to say it.  Try something like:  Your table's not ready yet, would you like to wait at the bar?  Then the bartender decided I was taking too long to decide from the cocktail menu and said he would go make the other three orders and come back for mine.  When he returned, I ordered the same cocktail my husband had.  In a vaguely contemptuous tone, the bartender urged me to try it first, ""to make sure.""  I did and said that's what I wanted.  He then informed me, very inappropriately, that he could have made two at once but now had to go make another one.  I pointed out that he walked away before I could order.  He replied it was because I was taking too long to make up my mind.

I would not recommend it as a romantic getaway or as a replacement for any of the more ""themed"" hotel/casinos that Vegas is known for. Westgate is a straight-up hotel/casino.

I thought it was pretty tasty, although I have to admit that I had a more flavorful version elsewhere the following night. To drink I ordered the El Picante, which was absolutely perfect. The giant charred jalapeño on top imparted such a nice smokiness...best drink I've had so far in LV. I also inherited a friend's pineapple cider, which was very good.

Lunch was such a success that we came back for a quick dinner before leaving the hotel for the night. This time I ordered the Carnitas Taco, and it was flawless. The pork was juicy and flavorful, and the pineapple chunks provided some much-appreciated sweetness.

We tried to stop over Saturday during New Years holiday which was a big NO. We showed up about 12 PM and the line was way too long. It was nice seeing the lion dance in the Asia plaza but we had to bail. We tried again Sunday at 10:30 and there was not even a wait. We were seated quickly but it took awhile to get drinks ordered. It's what you'd expect from a Chinese restaurant with the service.

We came for the dim sum and that is exactly what we got. Between 3 people we felt like there was an endless amount of dishes we picked out. My favorite was the soup dumplings which we waited to see if they were going to bring around in a cart but found out it is something to ask your server as they make it fresh in the back. Definitely recommend!

We had the typical dishes, shu-mai, pot stickers, congee soup, steamed pork ribs, turnip cake, shrimp noodle rolls, beef tripe, and wood ear mushroom salad. I'm a huge fan of turnip cake and they were definitely up there but everything else was pretty average.

Definitely worth visiting while you're in the area, dim sum options were nice, plenty of space, lines can be long, service was as expected and the food was just okay for me except the turnip cake and soup dumplings!",1,a-WWz_-O2IPXeSrEcl6FpQ

Usually, pretty desserts don't taste as good as they look... but S&B treats are the exception to this rule!

By the time I got to their booth, they had sold out... thankfully, a couple of my friends nabbed some before the rush! Not only was the product unique (great for party favours!), but it was the most delicious thing I ate at that food event that night.

I ordered their ""Dirty Dozen"" for a cottage weekend -- a variety pack of mini cupcakes, with flavours ranging from smores to red velvet, salted caramel to chocolate chip cookie -- and was this hit of the weekend.

It's run by Barb and her husband Patrick who are from Guyana.  There son helps out at the shop as well.

There homemade bread is soft and spectacular.  I especially love the no-bone goat and jerk chicken rotis.  You can wash it down with some Ting.  

Beware, the owners have mixed feelings about how popular they are amongst self-described foodies.  They close at 7 pm, are not open Sundays or Mondays, and close down for about a month each year around January/February.

This spot has quickly become a favorite of mine and as reluctant as I am to share with the masses, it deserves to be enjoyed by many. And let's be real, I need this place to thrive so I have a place to go on my afternoons. I'll cut to the goodies you want (why we all yelp in the first place...) 
Reasons why I love this place: 
- Consistent and attentive (without bugging) service. From my very first visit, I was treated like a friend coming over for a drink. I feel comfortable coming here alone to work and study and never feel rushed. Food comes up quickly and thus far, I've never had something I didn't like and never had an order arrive wrong. 
- EXCELLENT FOOD AND COCKTAILS! Seriously. Try the Roro burger or fish tacos. TBH, everything is delicious AF. Can't go wrong. Sauces are flavor-packed, food is cooked to order, and is plated (or basketed?) with care. It's in the little details here and they've impressed me with their attention to them. 
- A REAL Happy hour. None of that ""we just have a drink special or $1 off wells/ tap/ etc."" They do half off all alcoholic beverages including ALL of their lovely cocktails! I've always been meh about Paloma's but this place has made me fall in love with them. Happy hour is from open to 6pm I believe. 
- The atmosphere. Interesting music, small business feel, beautiful patio, simple and cute plant-based centerpieces. If you sit at the bar (you may find me there) it feels like you have a coveted kitchen seat with prime access to the bartender.

We all had their Cadillac margaritas, which was good not spectacular - but we were all in the mood to have a few drinks. Had mojito, sangria, and one other drink that I can't remember now. Their drinks are strong and hit the spot.

We had chips and guacamole, tuna tostada, chopped salad for appetizer, then sea bass, filet mignon, shrimp diablo, and skirt steak as entrees with sides of mexican risotto, wild mushrooms, and spinach with jalepeno.

Of course they have to have great guacamole -- it's a standard for Mexican! No?

The Tuna tostada was interesting... it's a tortilla triangle with a thin layer of tuna with some type of sweet glaze. i liked it a lot, but the rest of the table was just OK about it. We all thought the chopped salad was delicious - lots of little chunky veggies and seasoned so it was a tad on the sweet side but enough acid to balance. I'd eat just that for lunch.

Everyone enjoyed their entrees. I think the sea bass was the best. It was steamed in parchment, and was the most moist and flavorful fish I've had in a while. Next time I go back for dinner, I'm going to order sea bass. Both of the steaks were good but it's steak - nothing special in my opinion. My shrimp diablo was good, just a tad salty but great flavors - a little spicy but tasty. I only at two shrimp -- it came with six -- because I was too full by then. The bed of mexican herbal rice that came with my shrimp was really really good. The sides especially the wild mushrooms are a must. The risotto was OK along with the spinach.

Usually, I go for lunch, and it was the first time for dinner, and it was great. The only uncomfortable thing about the meal was at the end, our waiter come to tell us that we only left him $36 in tip which was 15% (I don't tip on the tax) -- which I thought was a bit rude for a waiter to come and tell you that you had only tipped 15%. We all sort of looked at each other and said, OK... we'll discuss it. We left him a few more bucks...but honestly, it sort of ended a great evening with an odd feeling for the restaurant.",1,5GspHkZ5LaGPnx2xKXcIHQ

I brought in my iPhone 6 in December 2015. The very day I'd spilled some coffee on it. It got extremely hot & turned off. So I rushed it over to U Break I Fix stat! But the gentleman behind the counter @ U Break I Fix said there was nothing that could be done. So we took the SIM card out of the damaged phone and put it into another 6 that we had & left the store.

Everything seemed to have transferred to the new phone. Pictures, contacts, apps. It wasn't until a few wks later I noticed that some old ""voice memos"" I'd had on the damaged phone didn't transfer. I was crushed! But blamed myself for not backing the phone up better....

Then 2 weeks ago (we're now into March 2016) my Dad breaks his old iPhone 4. & where do I bring my dinosaur of an iPhone? To U Break I Fix, of course. Like always. But while I was on Yelp...I see all these reviews about how U Break I Fix repaired so & so's  liquid damaged phone & etc?!? So I ask the manager Grant...and he explained that Yes...they do have this ability?!?! And sometimes they get great results?!? So I brought back in the damaged iPhone 6...after it sat in a desk drawer for 3 months...and they worked on it all weekend, to no avail. 

I repeatedly asked when did this new fix for water damage start? Because in December the employee I spoke to said there was no hope? But 3 months later you can repair water damaged equip? But I never got a definitive / straight answer. One guy said he was brand new. & the manager said something along the lines of ""everyone has different levels of training""? I just wish I'd had their top guy in December! I'm mostly mad at myself. For 2 reasons. 1. Not backing up important memories correctly 2. Just taking U Break I Fix's word for the repair. Clearly they aren't the only game in town. Definitely should've gotten a 2nd opinion.

7303,El4FC8jcawUVgw_0EIcbaQ,0,2015-04-30 00:56:04,3,9BGuIV3dCXOkJ3kmCjg7Zw,"I stayed at MGM Grand last weekend for my first & very likely last time. I was excited to try it & assumed the pretty penny that it cost would be returned to me in at least a mostly enjoyable experience. I was wrong.

The Good: 
1. We chose to pay the $30 for the express check-in feature because Friday check-in lines are ridiculous & painful. We were helped after just a few moments. 
2. The young woman who checked us in was delightful. When I asked about upgrading to a two queen room she took care of it for us without hesitation. 
3. Our room was modern & clean, albeit small (We were in a Grand Queen Room). 
4. The Lazy River was the best part of the vacation, while it lasted. We had fun, the water was heated to the perfect temp for an overcast day, & the bartenders at the Casting Call bar were friendly. We were asked to exit the water after about an hour for ""cleaning"" which cut the fun short & we ended up just heading back to our room because it was too cloudy to hang out outside the water. This threw a wrench in the most enjoyable part of the stay. 

The Bad: 
Where do I start? 
1. The cords, from what I can only guess was a window cleaner, banging against our window first thing in the morning on a Saturday? That was horrible & lasted nearly two hours. News Flash MGM Grand, people stay up late in Vegas, the last thing they want is to be woken up by cords bouncing against their window & making a racket early in the morning. 
2. After being awoken so early I went down to the Starbucks to pick up some coffee. Bad idea, there were at least 75 people in line. Insanity. I gave up & headed back to Corner Cakes since their line was smaller. After being told they do not accept the coupon that was in my room I paid $31 for 4 donuts (not cronuts, just 4 regular donuts), 2 drip coffees, a milk & an orange juice. 
3. On my way up from Corner Cakes I find the elevator bay full & see that one of the lifts is stopped halfway between floors, full of people, & employees on the ground asking them to remain calm. That inspires confidence right? I head up on the next working one only to find, with everyone else stuffed into it, about half way, all of the buttons were suddenly unlit & now we're going down.
4. There was also Rainforest Cafe, where after waiting forever to be seated, we were told by our server he would be ""right with us"" only to wait over an additional 10 minutes to have our drink order taken. Then only 3 of our 4 meals came out together. I was left waiting 5 extra minutes for mine. The choice was for everyone else at the table to allow their food to get cold waiting for mine, or be half finished when mine arrived. Not a mention the server spilled root beer on my husband when refilling a cup. Totally worth the $120 we paid for the meal. 
5. The buffet. Wow. My husband went to use the restroom right after we were seated to wash his hands, & was directed out of the buffet, by a buffet employee, to a men's room on the casino floor. Upon his return the other employees at the front of the buffet weren't going to allow him back in, after we had JUST paid, & gave him a very bad attitude about the situation. Luckily the gentleman who had directed him out to the restroom to begin with noticed & came over to clear it up so he could eat the meal he paid for. I almost wish he hadn't. We both ended up with immediate stomach issues from the buffet & I ended up with terrible stomach cramps, vomiting, a headache...full blown food poisoning for days afterward. 
6. Then there was the issue of the sink & the toilet in the room. After running the water in the sink for more than a few seconds a sewer smell emanated out of the drain & then it would make a gurgling sound. That made me gag when brushing my teeth. The toilet had a sewer like smell whenever it was flushed as well.
7. It didn't help that our  itemized receipt would not load on the TV check out (2nd page had a failed to load error repeatedly) so I had to stop at the desk to get a print out before leaving to assure our charges were accurate (they were). 
8. Another concern was the Valet. When walking through the East Valet on our 2nd day we found the Valets driving the cars through the lot so fast & dangerously that they literally would honk the horn the entire time they were driving them from the drop until the cars were parked. After getting back into our vehicle at the end of our trip we found anything & everything we had left, from water bottles in cup holders to plugs or snacks in pouches or on the seats strewn throughout the car, having been thrown around by their careless driving. Everything was a mess. 

If just one, or maybe even two, of the problems had occurred I might have overlooked it, but this was just too much in 2 days. We are thoroughly disappointed. I wouldn't recommend the MGM Grand at this point. For the cost you can get better, or for the same experience you can pay less. It entirely ruined our weekend. We came home upset instead of rested.",5,cuq6jBzy3l3fj6ULblFDDQ

The place was happening. I realized later its a franchise in the city. I ordered one of their few vegetarian options, a grilled cheese sandwich with grilled mushrooms. And a side of cajun spiced fries. Both were stupendously good (and stupendously unhealthy). My grilled cheese consisted of two slices of 'bread' (more like savoury pancakes) with heaping amounts of cheese and mushrooms dripping out. The serving size was smallish (imagine a slightly overstuffed egg mcmuffin) but very filling. In comparison they overfilled my serving of fries (and I ate every single one...oh what a carb feast).

This is only scratching the surface of my problems here.  First, the service department is an absolute joke, and getting a hold of them over the phone is next to impossible because no one ever answers the phone.  I brought my 2010 Jeep Patriot to have a front end alignment done.  I get the car back and there was a terrible popping noise coming from the front when accelerating.  I took it back and they said it was the struts... Nope! THEY FORGOT TO TIGHTEN THE LUG NUTS AFTER THE ALIGNMENT!  I contacted Chrysler and they didn't seemed to be concerned by this at all.  Then I made them check the alignment because you can't align a car with loose wheels, they said they would not perform a front alignment because the tie rods were bad... When they did the first alignment they did a multi-point inspection and the tie rods were totally fine (I doubt they even checked the tie rods... Or anything for that matter).  They have absolutely no problem taking my money for aligning a car with bad tie rods but when it's on their dime, its all of a sudden not okay.....  Needless to say I got my money back.  They have also crushed my rocker panels on my brand new 2013 Dodge Dart, I made them fix it.  AND! apparently they do not test drive their cars after they perform repairs.  They installed a new steering gear on the Dart and I got in the car and it was making a terrible noise.  They service tech said to me they did not test drive my car after performing this major repair...  

The sales department is no better.  My sales person was excellent but the Manager, Chris Folta is extremely rude and knows nothing about cars.  Due to his lack of knowledge on the Darts, he messed up my special ordered car and didn't know a certain feature wasn't available on my trim level.  He also said to me and my mom out loud and in front of customers:  ""IF YOU DON'T TRUST US THEN WHY DID YOU BUY A CAR FROM US!?""  That is not customer service.

No, it's not A-OK! It's not all bad either.

Seeing the confusing  American Chinese / pseudo Japanese/ Thai lite menu I didn't want to commit and instead chose two appetizers : ""Crispy golden calamari served with our own spicy dynamite dipping sauce"" and I think Thai shrimp in sweet chili sauce - extra hot for me please. 

The weather at sunset was just perfect, I sat outside and chilled with a generous cup off Ecco Domani Pinot Grigio ($5) . If it wasn't for that I probably would have been pissed off with the food. 

The calamare itself wasn't bad. It wasn't crispy but it wasn't tough either and mercifully it wasn't buried deep in fried breading like so many places. Plus it came with a bit of marinated ginger, nothing Korean mind you, but still, nice. BAD, the so called ""spicy dynamite dipping sauce"" was a joke, a bad joke! Absolutely bland and tasteless (what was it mayo and paprika?) so mild you could feed it to a baby. 

I mentioned this to two of the kids working there but they looked lost, one even said that people don't order their Calamare spicy , I had to tell him spicy what the menu claims. Screw it! I ate the calamare without any sauce,picked on the ginger and washed it down with the wine. 

The proper description for the shrimp sauce should have been ""really, really sweet chili sauce""  My tastebuds were drowning in High Fructose sweetener,  good thing I had ordered extra hot it compensated, a little. The shrimp itself was passable and there were some bits of fresh veggies under all that so it didn't feel totally like junk food. No totally anyway.

They said no we don't want the same thing happening as last time so you will have to pay the extra money or get the F out of here.  I told them especially after the embarrassment and feeling of prejudice against me There was no way I would pay extra money for their problem.   I asked if they were willing to accepted the coupons I was given last time as a token of their apology for my chipped paint on behalf of the cashier who knew I got burned and knew they handled the problem very ineffectively and in many ways offensive.  They would not accept them because they said they only accept them on Thursdays and I asked if they could call the manager again to see if they will make an exception.  They were unwilling to take the effort so i flipped them off reversed out of their lot screeching my tires and I personally am never coming back.  This is the worst business I have ever witnessed and if you want to keep your car nice, feel like you matter and that you are respected on a business to consumer level do not do business with these morons.  This is not a biased review.  This is 100% word for word a normal review of my account and I need to put this out there so I can save you all from the pain and embarrassment this crooked, unprofessional and in some ways illegal actions this so called business brought to my pride and joy not just my truck but my actual pride and joy.  Good day.

Stephanie was my stylist and she was great. She answered all of my questions and was very pleasant. Unlike another reviewer, I actually liked that we didn't talk the entire time. It's nice to zone out and play on your phone while someone is working away on your hair. 

I took off one star for two reasons.

1) During the hairwashing process, I was presented with which colours I wanted (from a big book). It was super uncomfortable to raise my head halfway during this, while someone else was washing my hair. I actually had a sore neck the next day from straining it. 

2) The chair where you get your hair washed and the chair where you sit while your hair is being coloured are not comfortable. Defs recommend they invest in some cushions or longer chairs so your legs can stretch out more.

Well, they were right.  Presentation and tons of flavor - not what we are used to seeing at Indian restaurants out here in Vegas. This review really teeters around 4.5 stars...

We started off with the Chicken Chili Stir fry and Lamb Seekh Kabob. Both had intense flavor and were SPICY (just the way we asked for it). 

Following appetizers, we had the Chicken Makhani and Rogan Josh. The chicken makhani was buttery -- just the way it should be! Now, I'm not too big of a lamb fan because of the weird gamey aftertaste it has but the Rogan Josh was out of this world. Tender, boneless and unbelievable. The naan was nice and fluffy (not the burnt kind you see at other Indian joints). They served us a plate of onions, lemons and chilies without us even having to ask!

I also ordered a side of okra which is my favorite vegetarian dish. It was good but not as great as my dad makes :)

The chef served us a complimentary dessert which was a little piece of heaven. Saffron poached pear with vanilla ice cream and an orange panacotta. Out of this world!

I'm going to try and make this as quick as possible (it didn't happen).

Price:
-more expensive than I'm used to spending: $130 per night.
-offers ""discounts"" including a caregiver discount, which I took advantage of.
-price does not include $20 ""resort fee"" for spa and gym use, doesn't include taxes, etc. Expect to add on $30-$40 in fees.

Location:
-isolated. Only things close by are the casino, Rawhide, and the new Phoenix Premium Outlets.
-very secluded, makes for nice walks out on the nature trail. Picturesque views on golf course and via trail rides. 

Rooms:
-I was granted a courtesy upgrade (don't know why) to a ""preferred guest room"", which was very nice. Had a deep soaking tub and a standing shower, queen (?) size bed, personal patio, all the amenities and a view overlooking the lake/pool.
-FAR WALK to the rooms. Almost every review discusses this. If you have elderly/young kids traveling with you, I would suggest requesting a closer room.
-phone in my bedroom did not work (granted it looked like it'd been there since the 80s).
-mini bar key must be obtained from the front desk or bell hop (mine didn't work, had to request a new one).
-AC unit in the rooms does not sufficiently cool the space. I knocked it down to 65 degrees and it was barely tolerable in the room. 
-Native American (Pima/Hopi) decorations throughout the room and resort.

Food/Beverages:
-never got to experience either of the restaurants as they were closed during most of my stay.
-room service comes with a hefty price, didn't see room trays cleared right away.
-resort bar was also closed when I returned to the hotel.

Staff:
-my check-in staff (gentleman) was very polite, he was the one who ungraded my room and gave me a gift certificate (free) to the Phoenix Premium Outlets ($25). 
-was unable to reach the operator from my room as the phone wasn't working, had to call using my cell. However, she was very polite sending up the mini-bar key.
-check-out staff was atrocious. It was hot and miserable in the lobby, a line of 5-6 guests were piling up. The woman who checked me out was very rude, I had questions about different fees/charges and also about the gift certificate. Her answers were very short and condescending. 

Perks:
-pretty nifty discounts with ""added perks"" like gift certificates if you look into it
-free shuttle to and from the hotel/casino, the outlets and Rawhide I believe
-mostly courteous staff, doors opened for you, etc.
-loved the comfortable mattress and pillows-- slept like a dream

Dings:
-parking lot is an eternity away. I will valet next time.
-rooms are also an eternity away. Will plan on requesting a closer room.
-bar/restaurants seem to have very limited hours for a high-end resort
-pool closes at 11PM... what the hell. Seriously? it's Arizona. 
-customer service not across the board (see checkout comment).

One is Quartier Perse and the other is Tehran, but I decided to give this place a shot even though the reviews were very split. 

Let's talk about the appearance first, it's relatively small restaurant, in a basement. Dress warmly if it's cold outside, as it's a bit frisky inside the restaurant. Minimal decoration but cozy and clean. 

Now about the food, the appetizers were very good, from the soup to the eggplant, to the warm bread they bring when u come in. Tasted better than in other restaurant i have  been. As for the main dish (kababs). The sour fillet mignon wasn't that great, I wouldn't recommend it. But the normal fillet mignon and the ground beef were good, very tasty. The rice however was overcooked and a bit smokey. I had only a spoonful of rice. Persian basmati rice is long grained and fluffy this was far from that.

That took over an hour, since as a city dealership, they have to go get the car.  The car ran out of gas on the way, so there was that delay as well.  I looked and left, asking the salesperson to provide pricing via e-mail because I was out of time by the time they got the car there.   

There were some wires crossed in the communication, but we eventually all got on the same page and I made an appointment at 9am the following Saturday to show them my trade and complete a cash purchase.  I had already shown my tendency toward impatience on the previous visit.  And I very clearly stated that I didn't want to be there all morning when I made the appointment, so I was hoping that they'd have everything ready except for my trade value.  Not so much.  

The trade evaluation was quick, but then the inefficiency really started.  They didn't have the pricing ready, so there was a wait there.  Then the finance guy was needed (no loan, but he also does title work and the warranty sales spiel ).  He had not a thing prepared either, so I had to wait for him.  Then to the cashier, who had to call and verify my check and issue a receipt - more waiting.  The tech guy who explained all the buttons was next - had to wait for him too.  His spiel needed a little work, but it was good enough.  Then the car needed gassed - again, another wait. 

All told, an efficient process could have easily taken under an hour.  This took over two and a half and that was with me quite impatiently skipping pieces and trying to push it along.  The problem is that their whole process is linear - you are passed from one person to the next with a lot of waiting in between.  Why they can't gas up the car while I am doing the paperwork is beyond me.  Why the tech guy couldn't have done his thing in the 45 minutes I spent waiting for the finance guy is also beyond me.  Why the cashier couldn't have worked on my check while I was doing title work...you get the idea.   

I am sure that people generally spend a ton more time buying a car and perhaps that is normal, but I made an appointment specifically to avoid all of that.  If they are truly serving the luxury market, they need to coordinate the buying process better.",6,h9LPugJk2cpIh0gmQb5LnQ

I love that Trader Joes actually tastes the food it puts out there and I know when I buy something knew that there is a 90% chance I will like it b/c it's gone through a taste review test. Unlike Whole foods who seems to put everything out there and the taste usually bland. The people that work at Trader Joes are generally very nice. There is one woman there that does not like to double bag b/c the bags hurt her hands, so I purchased the clothe bags instead. I feel for people that struggle especially if they are elderly. For 5 dollars I could make her work easier. Even though I tend to forget my bags. My favorite food at Trader Joes is addictive and I go back for the same things every week. 
I love the pre-made food isle when you walk in past the bread...the sushi is good and cheap, the homestyle potato salad..yum. The chickpea salad is addictive!  And I love the turkey and mashed potatoes.
In the frozen section the Chinese fried rice with edamame is really good. They have pumpkin filled burritos are delicious. I wish they would confirm that the corn is organic though as there was a black sting thing in my last burrito that made me question it. And love that item if they can fix that issue. 
The oriental chicken sweet and sour chicken in frozen is really good. The thick pie mini pizzas are delicious. I did not like the mushroom cheese pizza without tomato sauce though, that item I threw out. The chicken wings are great! 
One thing I did not like was that I started to buy my meat from Frys because the meat at Trader Joes seemed to have a stink to it and I would throw it out. This would happen now and then from Frys' but it seemed to happen everytime at Trader Joes and they should look into why it's stinking and if it's a transport issue. I don't know. And the organic chicken they had that was not kosher didn't seem to have any flavor. So I stopped buying my meets from them.
The cheese area Is amazing. I love the cheddar pub cheese and wish they would add it with port wine and cheddar pub cheese.  The blueberry wrapped goat cheese is amazing. 
Also, Trader Joes why do you put food coloring in your items? If I see food coloring I skip buying that item as food coloring that isn't natural causes cancer. Why do you add it sometimes?? Our govt isn't protecting us, so we have to do it ourselves.
But all in all, I love TRADER JOES ..It IS THE BEST!!!
Keep up the good work and work on improving some of the things I have mentioned.
Also, the dolmas by the jarred olives are amazing. These are greek rice and grape leaf wraps. Yummy!! 
Trader Joes please look into delivery for the people that cannot drive to you. That would be AMAZING! DELIVERY DELIVERY DELIVERY!
Also, get Kambucha drinks!  And Organic green smoothies. I won't buy your green smoothies unless it's pesticide free. I don't want the cancer causing Monsanto roundup herbicide in my drink and in my body. I get enough from the air. I want organic as much as possible only. 
If you had hydroponic grown vegetables that were organic we organic lovers would flock to you even more to not have to have food grown in outdoor air where the govt is spraying poisonous ""chemtrails"" on the population with cancerous chemicals that we all breath in.

Seats: It would be helpful if the rest of the yelpers include their seating in their reviews! But yea we got MIDDLE SEATS in the house babyyy!! Awesomenesssssss. I was afraid that upper orchestra (Section 201-205) would be too far away from the stage but it's not! If you really want to be close, then get the highest seats in lower orchestra. Trust me, you do not want to be tooo close because you won't get to see EVERYTHING. 

Price: I tried my best to look for a great deal but it was tough finding one. I just went ahead and booked mine through the Bellagio and later found out they have 25% off! Even though it says no refund/exchange but I called in for an upgrade and they gave it to me anyway! The original price for our seats would have been $165 but it was only $120 with 25% off! NEATO.

O: I think I had too much expectation for this show so it wasn't that great like I thought. Now you know, just because it's the most expensive show, it may not be the best. I still think Le Reve is better for some odd reasons! I mean O is good and all but it got a bit repetitive toward the end. Some of my favorite parts were the fire and swing performance. I don't know how they did it but the guy's body was on fire the whole time! And they did an amazing job with the swinging back and forth, though 1 person did drop. -__- Ohh and the clowns were funny! ""ayyydzaaaa"" hahahah that was hilarious! 

Just FYI: If you get limited views for upper orchestra between Section 201-205, it's because of the side rails that will block you.

As I pulled up beside the vehicle at a red light (just above Deerfoot Trail, by the zoo), I looked over and saw the gentleman with his cell phone up to his face. What makes this even more disheartening, in today's world of business. So I called on my Bluetooth the number on the van and left a message for a ""Jason"", with my name and phone number. I arrived back at work and Jason had returned my call. Well, as the Manager of 5 Star Seniors Relocators, I explained to Jason that the vehicle which I briefly caught up to was doing 90km on a 70km road, his 1st response was, ""The vehicle was empty"". He then defended the driver, by saying, that he was only doing 82km. How he knew that....... Jason was in the vehicle with the driver....OMG
Jason became very argumentative with me yelling at me that his driver was ONLY doing 82km in a 70km (on Memorial Drive). I did respond with 90km, which is exactly what his driver was travelling at. I then asked him why his driver was on his cell phone while in a running vehicle and possibly even while driving. I expressed to him that with him being a manager, that doesn't seem to be the best scenario for the employees having him as a manger and allowing them to break the law, with him beside them. Jason abruptly  hung up the phone on me. So as a consumer, who has grand parents and many of my friends have grand parents in senior's facilities, I would strongly suggest going with a different moving company. If you have used them before and something got broken, its because they drive TOO fast and don't support defensive driving techniques. As well, if you have complained and dealt with Jason, which turned out to be a negative experience, don't worry because ignorance is probably his only trait and as a business owner, I would have never hired a person of such poor business manners and extremely poor ethics. Five Star Seniors Relocators is a terrible company to deal with, simply because they employ Jason and are extremely poor decision makers when it comes to hiring/training drivers (which is the only way to transport any seniors precious belongings), in a city of 1.4 million potential customers.",0,iUQ2B7p6Df6OwRz9JwRCFQ

The service was horrible. The food was greasy. The second trip was in response to a complaint that we called in to the restaurant. Even then, nothing improved. It is real sad to see the Taco Mac of the 1980s is now gone. The present day, cookie-cutter Taco Mac is just pathetic.

Addendum:  As you can see, my review was responded to by one of their staff.  Well, I think it is all an empty gesture.  Avoid the Taco Mac of today.  It is NOTHING like the ones that used to be scattered around Atlanta in the 1980's.  As for the response from Taco Mac, I see lots of them from the staff of Taco Mac on various reviews.  So, here's some food for thought:

1 -  Our second visit was because of a poor, disgusting visit the first time.  It was VERY apparent NOTHING had changed between the two visits.  Why would I accept a second comp visit only to rack up a THIRD horrible experience?  Fool me once, shame on me.  Fool me twice, shame on you.  Fool me a third time, I am just a f*****g idiot for going back again.

I absolutely love the location of the stadium, right on the water in downtown Cleveland, close to many fabulous restaurants and other sporting venues. The stadium itself was also nice- though our seats were of course covered with snow (something we didn't plan well enough for I can say). We sat in one of the 500 sections near center field and had a great view, and got to chat with numerous season ticket holders. The fans at the stadium overall were great- sure we got jeered a bit- but we were visitors so I expect that on the road. The workers were all great- when I was looking for my commemorative pin and one location didn't have it- they pointed me right to the correct spot. Numerous stadium employees stopped and shook our hands- said welcome to Cleveland, and Go Browns- which I loved.

All we really wanted to do was ride a few rides, take a few pictures with pumpkins and pick pumpkins to take home and decorate. This place is pumpkin patch on overload. There are rides, games, food tent and a pumpkin patch area/picture taking area.

Rides and Games: The family booklet of 25 tickets for $20 bucks sounded like a great deal but with two kids and and rides and games being 3-5 each, that leaves very limited fun to be had. A handful of rides/games weren't even working which is was kind of sad. 

Food Tent: It looked good, but the lines were so long that we passed.

Pumpkin Patch/Photo Area: Pumpkins ranged from $10 for small head sized pumpkins to $30 for a huge pumpkin. But careful because the pumpkins you pick from the photo area have been stepped on, sat on, tossed and kicked by people capturing their moments at the pumpkin patch. Not to mention the cost is pretty steep. They had miniature pumpkins for .99 cents.

My room had a small balcony and overlooked the ""Carnaval Court"" which is an open-air nightclub venue. Some people would probably not like the fact that this leads to loud music blasting every afternoon and night and the sound coming through the walls/windows. However, I enjoyed some time hanging out in the room with the sliding door open, taking in the warm air and music.

I typically gamble at MGM Grand, so having a monorail station right off the back of Harrah's was very convenient.

I had several breakfasts at the buffet and all were good. The staff throughout the hotel were friendly and helpful.

Complaints? There is no Wi-Fi. There is supposedly hardwired internet. I found a cable sitting in the nightstand drawer, but I didn't see anywhere in the wall to plug it into. Not that it would work with an Ipad anyway. The water pressure was pretty weak, and the lighting in the shower area is poor. The entrance roads from the Strip to check-in are full of unmarked speed bumps everywhere, pulling in at night I think I beat my rental car's suspension pretty hard.

The girl behind the counter looked like she loathed her job and was impatient with us since we weren't familiar with their ordering process. She robotically asked, ""how many doughnuts"" with a blank stare. We were new and we didn't have a set #, we were just shopping the display window and picking each variety as we go - are we terrible people?

We made rushed decisions and didn't feel welcomed to ask questions about the doughnuts. We ended up selecting 6 for $8. The doughnuts were good, but not life changing. I'm glad the doughnuts didn't taste like pure sugar but they could also use an extra edge or some sort of wow factor.

Doughnuts:
* Blueberry mousse - nothing too blueberry about the mousse, just the purple color and the blueberry garnish. The doughnut itself was very simple cake doughnut. 3/5

* Strawberry shortcake - very standard cake doughnut, using the same base like the above doughnut. Some white frosting drizzle and a little bit of tart and sweet chunky strawberry topping. The topping had small chunks of chopped strawberry and it really woke up the simple doughnut. Also finished with a dot of whipped cream on top. 4/5

* Cinnamon spice - standard cake doughnut simply coated in cinnamon sugar. It was a hair short of tasting like a churro. That's too bad. The dough was very doughy and dense. 2/5

* Buttermilk bar - tastes just like the classic - crispy glaze on the outside and doughy on the inside. 4/5 

* Classic glazed twist - tastes just like the classic, but oversized. You can't go wrong with this one. 4/5

They really didn't have a huge selection or variety tonight. I was looking for fun ones like the green tea or even the fat elvis one I saw on yelp. Nope, none of them showed up. They kept running out of flavors and taking doughnut cards down. Im not sure if that's a typical night for them or if I caught them on a bad night.

Now the car I bought is not the issue. The issue is the car I traded in. The night I bought the car, I gave them my old car in trade along with the tittle. That was in march. Now I have started receiving notices in the mail that the car I traded in has been ticketed multiple times for no registration somewhere downtown. I contacted the DMV and was told the car was still titled to my husband and no paperwork from the dealership was ever submitted. And if you sell the car you have to turn the tittle in within 30 days. The tickets are over 30 days old. So I call parking enforcement and sent in a copy of the sales contract that shows the Vin of the traded car but was told I needed a bill of sale or a liability waver. So I tried to call ABC when they opened at 9 am I was told no one answers till later since they like to get settled in, so I went in person and the GM and the finance manager treated me like shit. I told them I needed something to prove I no longer owned this car and the contract wasn't enough. I also asked what happened to the car title and they wouldn't tell me. They didn't understand why I was so upset... I told them that because of their negligence my husbands license could be suspended and they could tow our other car for non payment of these tickets. The GM made a phone call and the told me I had to call the person he was speaking to so I could get the paperwork..... HUH? He was just on the phone with them. So I asked why couldn't he just have them emailed. He threw the phone number at me and said that it is my job..... WTF? his dealership fucked up and did whatever with the tittle and now we suffer for it. I left the dealership fumming. I called the number and spoke to a woman who was understanding and helpful. When I finally got the documents emailed to me she told me Cody the finance manager was emailing them..... so the finance Manger who gave me attitude was the one who emailed me the documents.... so instead of helping me while I was there he just treated me like shit. This place is a joke. I have now reported them to the state for not filing documents with the dmv, I filed an official complaint with Hyundai corporate, and I am calling the news. I personally think they dumped the car because of its age and this is why it was never really tillted.

I scored myself a 3 veggie plate ( I chose fried squash, green beans and yams) with a roll, and a side of ranch for dippin' fried squash for a fiver and change. The fried squash were thin, hot and crispy. Probably the best I've had in Charlotte ( since Louis's is technically in Harrisburg) and the green beans were tasty too. I'm not well versed in yams but I like mine a touch more al dente than how they serve them up here but that's just a minor critique since they still tasted good.

The staff was super friendly. The lady that took my to go order made sure I got my food fast and even used my name when she handed me my order ( always a nice touch). The owner ( I assume) was around and was also wonderfully chatty and helpful.

It was odd to me that I needed to pay up front, but they wouldn't give it to me without payment. So, I paid. I have two insurances--one did not pay, but the other paid quite a bit. I was told that if insurance covered, they'd put a check in the mail right away. Those were their words. I've seen nothing. I've yet to go in to try to get my money. I'll update when I do. 

The next issue was that my daughter supposedly needed four crowns. She'd been at a pediatric dentist. But she is 17 and he noticed she had one problem area that look like a possible crown and her pediatric dentist felt she was ready to go to a regular dentist. He said her teeth looked great except for that one spot. So, we go to Providence Dental where they tell us she needs at least four crowns and possibly root canals. I tell the dentist that her pediatric dentist didn't say she needed all of that. His response? ""That's why you need to take kids to a real dentist. I wouldn't take my own kids to a pediatric dentist past the age of seven."" So--a pediatric dentist isn't a real dentist? 

When we walked in for one of my daughter's appointments, the gal at the front desk tells me my amount after insurance. It was really high. I was confused but almost paid it, but then I stopped and said, ""Is that with both of our insurances?"" She says, ""Yes, but since you're getting x type (can't remember what it is called) of crowns, your insurance won't cover it."" So, I asked what type of crowns those are. She explains they're a special kind of crown but covered by a warranty, blah blah blah. I tell her no one mentioned those to me before this. Are they mandatory? She says, no they're optional. So, they were trying to upsell me these special crowns without even telling me anything about them before hand. She tells me that they're really great and under warranty so if anything happens they can be fixed or replaced. I tell her I had a crown that fell out once and my insurance fixed it--so why would I pay for an expensive crown that insurance won't cover if I can pay for a normal crown that insurance will cover. She just looked at me. She had no answer. It was ridiculous. 

After that visit, I decided we weren't going back. I started hunting for a new dentist. My husband still planned to continue going to Providence Dental. He had an appointment in December but had to reschedule due to his crazy work schedule. So, he switched it to February. In February, he had to reschedule again. This time he told the lady he just wanted to cancel and would reschedule when things calmed down at work. She was extremely rude to him. She kept pressing him to just reschedule and if he couldn't make it, he could reschedule again. He insisted that he had no idea when to make the appointment because of work and would just feel better making the appointment when he had a better idea of an opening in his schedule. She kept sighing heavily and being snippy with him. So, he's decided he's done there too. 

Two of my kids are still at their pediatric dentist. We've been with that dentist for over a decade. We've never had an issue with the staff, with the dentist or with billing.

Friends chose this hotel as it was the best priced option on Expedia with her points or something. Self parking was ok but hard to find a space that Friday evening. What we noticed, on each day, was that many of their parking structure escalators were NOT working. Meaning, tired people like us, and many others, had to schlep their luggage down flights of non working escalators (which is kinda scary). 

Check in was easy but crowded. There could have been more staff checking in patrons that holiday weekend. They have complimentary water in self service dispensers near by so that was appreciated (NOTE: a few times the water dispensers were empty and not refilled). 

They have designated elevators for three section of floors (it 1-12, 13-x, etc). Makes for quicker access to your floor.

Our room was clean with two queen beds. The room had a nice view of Luxor and the airport (if a view of airport can be even 'nice'). The beds were comfortable but we felt the pillows were too plush and too high. The bathroom had a shower, a tub, two sinks, and a toilet with a separate door. It had basic toiletries (conditioner, shampoo, soap, lotion).

The two closet space was nice. 

Huge con: NO COMPLIMENTARY COFFEE at all. No coffee grinds. Sad. 

The show ticketing area was nice and made it easy to book Cirque shows. Be aware there's like a $15 convenience PER TICKET even if you book a cirque show that's inside their own hotel.

Self parking is $10/day but has in and out privileges. You can also park at any MGM hotel with that $10/day fee (just use your room key). 

We ate at Lupo and Citizens at the hotel. Lupo was alright (birthday dinner) but Citizen's breakfast was spectacular.

PORK BUNS. As incredible as they are in New York. Consistency is key.
RAMEN. Good, but not great. The broth was a little too dense for my liking. I seem to recall the broth in my Momofuku Ramen at the original Noodle Bar being a bit thinner. Noodles were chewy. Egg was runny. Pork belly was pork belly.
CHICKEN AND EGG. Husband enjoyed this. Chicken was tender and not remotely lean (remember, you're at Momofuku Noodle bar). I took a bite with all of the ingredients mixed together and thought the cucumber slices set off the flavours really well.
ROASTED RICE CAKES. Nowhere near as tasty as the rice cakes at Ssam bar, with the spicy sausage and all, but still a good snack. Great texture. Bouncy, chewy, firm. They're good.

SERVICE. Excellent, friendly and efficient.
AMBIANCE. Bright, modern, and industrial but comfortable. Surprisingly spacious, especially compared to the cramped digs in New York. Since it was weekday lunch, there was a mixed crowd. Suited-up corporate drones dined happily alongside thick-rim glasses, grandpa sweater wearers.

First annoyance: Closed Sundays and many non-standard restaurant closing days during the year.  Since, I don't work in that area anymore I can only go there evenings and weekends.  I can't recall how many times I craved this place after a round of golf.

Second annoyance: I don't think I've been able to have their doubles for over a year now.  Why? Because they NEVER have any (it seems) outside the hours of 12-5pm.  I would go there after work time after time and no doubles every time.  And it's not like they won't be able to sell them.  Many people come in after me between 7-9 and ask for doubles.

Third annoyance: Their portion size for their Oxtail dinner has gone WAYYY down.  It was my favourite thing to get but after the last time when I got TWO PIECES (literally), I don't want to get it anymore.  I don't get full from it and it's the most expensive thing on their menu ~$7.50.

Those are the major annoyances so here is the good stuff.  The food is made fresh.  The rotis are spiced really nice and tasty.  Their oxtail is my favourite meat there.  I really like how their gravy is not ""goupy"" like like other places.  Its thin like a jus.

That area was practically empty too, so when his big brother joined him, they had the place to themselves and had lots of fun together.

Only downside is there wasn't really a good place to watch your kids.  All the tables were occupied with birthday party rentals, so we could only really stand on the far end to watch.  Looking at pictures, they may have added an upper level for seating (we went about 8 months ago).

Greg and his team did an amazing job on so many levels.  First, they listened to what I was looking for!  Other consultants in my experience seemed to have their own agenda.  This trio was incredible. They pulled gorgeous dress after gorgeous dress; and that's saying a lot given that I don't care for 99% of all bridal fashion.  Granted, I can appreciate all of it - just on other people. For myself, I envisioned something unique and, well, within my budget.

There was people in the bar without using the machines so finally when a couple decided to leave they told me and my husband that they got a spot for both of us. Second the place next to me smelled like trash and vomit, like fresh vomit recently being mopped. While we were playing the lady bartender asked my husband if he was enjoying his vaporizer, because she was not. She claimed that it was ""burning"" her throat. And that we should stop using it. Like really? You can said straight up vaporizers are not allowed instead of being rude. I guess they are not like that with people with cigarettes, because that's why your throat hurts, because you are in a closed environment where people smokes.

Unfortunately, I will not return because I had a very uncomfortable experience last weekend with a nail technician blaming me for a schedule mixup and raising her voice at me in front of other customers as she is doing my manicure. For 9 months I had always, always scheduled with the same two technicians.. one does my mani and the other my pedi simultaneously. I scheduled with both, signed in and indicated both their names and I also told the front desk that I am scheduled with both ladies. I was called back by the lady who does my pedicures and she stared my manicure instead. I was confused but I assumed the front desk arranged this because my manicure lady had just starts applying polish a few seats away on another customer. I had no problem with that and was willing to stay a little longer because I knew it was worth having the lady do both. Front desk came by and apologized for not telling the technician that I had scheduled with both and that it would take longer. I had no problem because mix ups happen and it was the first mishap anyway. As the lady is doing my pedicure she asked why I didn't notify her that someone else is doing my manicure. This caught me off guard and told her I thought it's what the front desk arranged. She raised her voice said no and that it was my job to tell her this info. I advised that it was a misunderstanding and again she raised her voice and said ""next time, you have to tell me"" in a very rude tone and I had about 4-5 technicians along with their customers staring at me. I finally snapped back raising my voice and told her to stop raising her voice at me because i don't work there and it isn't my responsibility to arrange it and she can discuss it with the front desk. I felt SO uncomfortable. I only go to her because her work is so clean regardless of the fact that in the last 9 months she can't even manage to look me in the face and say hi. She decided to be nice after and call me ""sweetie"" and ""love"" when time came to pay. I won't put up with that fakeness and rude attitude. I'd rather she not talk to me at all and just fix my nails rather than talk to me as if I owe her something. Owners weren't there so I'm leaving this review because this info probably never got to them even after I called and complained. Oh and the techs were arguing over who was going to do my pedi.

My normal person moved on to greener pastures so my appointment was set with Jenny. This was by far the most painful experience I've ever endured. I believe Jenny's real trade is shucking oysters, horse farrier or a mistress of pain. Four times she allowed the glue stick to slip between her fingers when she tried to remove it from my nostrils. This was extremely sloppy work and painful. However the most intense agony was yet to come. Somehow or another she managed to get glue on both sides of my mustache and her initial technique of removing it brought tears to my eyes and a few verbal cuss words.  Throughout this ordeal she never really apologized but said more than once; ""Oh that's painful"". Seriously?
I will continue going to Beauty Brands for my haircut because Lori cuts my hair and does a wonderful job and my wife likes it. I will never allow Jenny to touch anything on my body and I wouldn't recommend her to anyone unless you're into real pain.

Being vegetarian my options were limited so a veggie  burger it is. I'm not exaggerating when I say it was like they scooped a big helping of goulash on to my bun. There was no structure to it and it was mushy and bland. The fries were soggy like maybe they lingered under the heat lamp a while. My husband's turkey burger was satisfactory but certainly not outstanding. My daughter ordered spinach dip and it tasted like spinach mixed with cream. It was lacking any sort of cheese or onion flavoring and the chips were stale. The saving grace was my husband's shake (great). I asked them to make me a spiked root beer float & the waitress pleasantly said she could. But the $18.50 price tag for the float soured that experience as well. 

We checked out this morning and decided to at least have a conversation with the manager instead of complaining online. My husband explained  to Saka, the manager in detail how our food was served. My husband asked if they would please adjust that portion of the bill before we checked out and reiterated that the service was just fine. It felt like a scripted response with no real enthusiasm for correcting our experience. He said if we had talked to him that night he might have been able to do something for us. My husband explained it was very late and close to closing time with very little staffing in the restaurant. My husband was frustrated that the manager wasn't concerned about the quality of his product only that he was not making any adjustments to the bill. So with that said since he isn't going to listen I've decided to tell all of you. We're not going back. I hope your experience is a better one.",2,eH_4ym3WCg9TqjLM3LUPng

When we first walked in, around 530 in the evening on a Wednesday during an Indians game, there were maybe three other tables occupied in the restaurant. We stood in front of the hostess station while a waitress rolling napkins attempted to avoid our gaze and four other waiters/waitresses walked by us. We stood there for literally...ten minutes until the waitress who was trying to avoid us by folding napkins was told to seat us. 

Perhaps it was our fault for not saying anything? 

No, their service is just really poor, and none of the employees there really care about customer service. 

While I was waiting for someone to notice my boyfriend and I, the ambiance of the restaurant is fairly nice. Dimly lit, a little classier feel to it but nothing remarkable. There is no parking, you have to park in a garage. The bathrooms are weird public bathrooms down the stairs and around the corner, also. 

It was happy hour, and their specials were not communicated anywhere online, nor shown anywhere on the menu... and our waitress did a poor job verbally explaining it. Their signature martinis are not part of happy hour, and ONLY SOME APPETIZERS ARE $4.95. The Chocolate Bar randomly picks week to week, or day to day, or maybe they choose it based on what you order. I'm not really sure.  

As for drinks, I love chocolate-based liquory nonsense drinks. I would really recommend a Chocolate Covered Pretzel Martini, it was really well made, delicious, chocolately, and I couldn't taste the liquor. However, for my second drink I ordered a Nutella Martini, which was legitimately poorly made. It was not simply poured heavily, it did not taste like Nutella and the vodka was extremely apparent. I was really surprised they did not use Frangelico hazelnut liquor, or anything remotely resembling Nutella. I was also surprised that each Martini did not list the types of liquors in each. I personally think that the Hofbrauhaus has much better speciality dessert martinis for $8 (rather than $10 at the chocolate bar)

I did not have dinner, but I ordered a chocolate cake, and I have no complaints with it. It was rich, fudgey, yummy, but nothing I couldn't have gotten somewhere else. I can't remember what it was called, unfortunately. 

I don't really see a reason to come back here, particularly because of the service.",0,nfGC_3F7-urw7FirVRMcdA

I got there right at 9am, supposedly when they open, and I watched as the employees sat around on the counters and chatted in what seemed to be a staff meeting. It was freezing outside and considering it was 9am I was expecting the door to open any minute. 

I waited and I waited. I watched as one by one, the employees noticed me standing outside, and one by one, they peeked their heads around and just stared. You'd think someone would have come to my rescue, but nope. They just continued sitting around on the counters and occasionally looking back to see if I was still there. 

I finally got inside at 9:10am (which SUCKS because by this point, I'm late for work) and I told them I had to return an item. The assistant manager said ""Malcolm will help you on the other side"". So i walked around to the other side and I stood at the cash register waiting as Malcolm tried to figure out how to put his 'Winners' apron on. Finally, Malcolm looks at my item and says ""You're returning this? You cut off the tags"". I'm like ""Yeah, but I bought it 12 hours ago and it doesn't say on the receipt anything about keeping the tags on"". He lost it on me. He angrily pointed to this sign that Winners has that states their policy. He's all like ""You cut off the tags! You're not supposed to cut off the tags. We don't return items with the tags cut off."" Finally he said ""Fine, this ONE time, I'll do it, but never again"". He was BY FAR one of the rudest people I have ever dealt a minute after opening. 

Finally he finished punching away at the register, shoved the receipt and cash on the counter and completely ignored me. I grabbed it and left the store immediately. 

I will never, not EVER, step foot inside this Winners again. Their service is atrocious and I urge all my fellow Yelpers to pick any place to shop but this one.",5,Wx7cbLDqYEL3_aVZwh82Ww

I thought I'd leave it to fate to decide for me if I was swinging by SR or heading straight home from work.  Helen quickly replied with a list and even emailed a second time to determine if I was allergic to all corn products [yes I am :(].  My answer eliminated all of the sorbets, but she did say that the Tart Yogurt soft-serve is safe for me. 

First sample was the Tart yogurt, and yes, it was tart, palate-cleansing, and quite refreshing.  I would definitely order this on a cake cone someday, or have it in a cup with fresh strawberries!  Other flavors I tried were:

Chocolate Rosemary- D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S.  I am a fan of rosemary, a relaxing herb, so the combination of the two flavors was like ""the calm before the storm""; first, the whiff of rosemary enveloped me in a comforting embrace and then I was knocked over by bold chocolate!  This was definitely going into the pint cup I was taking home with me.  I knew I had to find another flavor that could stand up to this perfect duet.

Apple Pie- LOVED the textures in this ice cream.  Chunks of granny smith apples and bits of ginger and cinnamon spice.  Such huge flavors from such a tiny sample.  Unbelievable!  A huge contender in the pint-to-go category.

Sumatra Espresso Shot- WINNER!  I could definitely taste real espresso in this sample.  It'll be hard to find a better version than this!  And yes, I took home a pint of Chocolate Rosemary and Sumatra Espresso Shot.  I had to taste it when I got home, and I'm ashamed to admit that the container was only half-full when it finally found its way into the freezer.  I was slightly disappointed that I couldn't take home some Apple Pie, but Apple Pie, Espresso, and Chocolate Rosemary just didn't sound right.  I'm sure Helen and Jan can offer up something clever on my next visit!  

Maple Pecan- I had high expectations for this one, since I love pecans, but all I tasted was fine maple, and the pecans only gave the ice cream a crunchy texture.  Perhaps the bold flavors of apple, ginger, coffee, and chocolate saturated my tastebuds, and I therefore couldn't taste anything else.  I'm going to need to sample this first thing on my next visit.

Belgian Chocolate- Smoooooooth!  Oh yeah!  I had Helen whip up a brownie sundae incorporating scoops of Belgian Chocolate and Vanilla Bean, brownie chunks, fresh whip cream, and a long drizzle of Salted Butter Caramel sauce.  Oh my!  I am at a loss for words... 

Other store offerings include fresh-baked cookies (chocolate chip, meringue, molasses spice, and peanut butter), a buffet of toppings, ice cream sandwiches, and ice cream pies.  The store's interior was clean, colorful, and inviting. 

Kudos to Helen and Jan for offering up such high-quality sweets.  Now if only I could persuade them to add chocolate-dipped waffle cones and bowls to their cone selections of NAKED (not like Sweet Republic needs to add a sex element to sell its goodies!) waffle cones and waffle bowls.  Well, alright, the cones did have chocolate chips in the bottom, but it's just not the same.  Then again, with ice cream sandwiches and pies, shakes, sundaes, and cookies, who needs chocolate-dipped cones??",4,M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA

My last experience at the old Black Pig was, to put it mildly, a disheartening disappointment. Below average on all counts. Well, I guess I finally managed to get over the sting because I recently found myself, once again, wandering under the Black Pig signage.

Have you ever had a dining experience where everything went so well that you expected to be shat on by a bird upon exiting? I'm talking about something that hardly every happens, something so rare that you can only be snapped back into reality by an action of equal and opposite quality? That's what happened to me when I was here with my wife on a recent Saturday evening. Sometime around 6pm, if memory serves.

I can't be sure, but the innards of the restaurant appear to have remain relatively unchanged since it sailed under the Light Bistro flag. This isn't a bad thing, as I rather like the dark woods and brick thing going on, just an observation. If it ain't broke, right? We were shown to a seat in the main dining area by the windows up front. I love it when I get a seat with such awesome natural lighting. So good for Yelpie picture taking. Another bonus, the place was just lightly populated and pretty quite. Two more gold stars.

Our server, where to begin. Lenore was a delight. Pleasant, friendly, knowledgeable, charming. And I'm not talking about all of those things being painted in your typical ""I'm a server so I'm trained to act this way"", she seemed pretty damn genuine to me. I almost wanted to invite her to have a seat with us. Let's just say that she is an asset to the establishment and a role model for all looking to make a career of hospitality.

The menu is an exercise in culinary brevity and it's filled with dishes that you'll want to eat. Everything is made in house, and I mean everything. All of the food that we were served was beautiful, clearly plated with love and an eye for composition. I'm not one to wax poetic over how my food's arranged on my plate, but damn. Zacharian would be proud. As for the potent potables, let's just say they're made with the same attention to detail as the edibles. The beer list, as concise as the menu itself and unfortunately lacking a draught offering, still managed to keep the beer geek in me happy with a 21st Amendment Hop Crisis DIPA and Dogfish Head Festina Peche.

We started our dining experience with an order of bread paired with the house cheese plate. Holy soft, glutenous, seedy warm, smear some butter on me goodness. This bread was so fresh I thought I'd be forced to backhand it. The cheese plate was a bit like eating our way around an artist's palette. Crispy baguette and flat bread, a dollop of honey, sweet candied nuts, cranberry mostarda, and bits of cheese ranging from uber funky blue to slightly sweet and nutty gruyere. 

My wife thoroughly enjoyed her order of wild mushroom agnolotti. Folded and crimped house-made pasta pillows filled with earthy wild mushroom puree served with sauteed chanterelle and straw mushrooms, ridiculously fresh English peas and a sprinkling of fresh Pecorino Remano cheese. And butter. My god, the butter.

But the star of the evening, no question, was the short rib entree. This was a dish so good I starting dreaming about it while I was eating it. A dish so good that it has food all across the greater Cleveland area and as far north as Toronto rethinking its very purpose. When there's something this good, why even bother trying? But it's only short ribs, what's the big deal?

Two baseball-sized blocks of short rib cooked perfectly. Wait, perfectly doesn't do them justice. This meat was cooked like I'd imagine how Odin would cook meat. It was so tender that it laughed at me when I picked up my knife. Perfectly caramelized and glazed in a sauce with a flavor so deep James Cameron wants to dive it. Sure, the asparagus was nice - fork tender and slightly charred - and the roasted fingerling potatoes were just crispy enough and the pea puree as smooth as a Luther Vandross ballad, but the meat. If cows knew about this meat they'd want to eat it. Get the short ribs and you'll know what it must have been like for Jules when he opened Marcellus' briefcase.

I stopped in yesterday for lunch. The menu is pretty simple, sandwich, salad, pizza cone or veg or non veg bowl are basically your choices. I placed my order with a nice girl for a Veggie bowl, priced around 7 bucks. While waiting at the counter I noticed a few things... Lots of foil pans of food sitting around on carts and counters. Not sure if that's what the use to prepare all the orders or if it was a big catering order or what. I watch them make a pizza cone (they wear gloves, yay!), they dump mac n cheese into a previously used bowl that had been sitting on the counter and mix the barbecue meat into it and then add it to the cone with more meat (chicken, I think) on top. The use of the dirty bowl grossed me out. I also notice a gallon container of Sweet Baby Ray's sauce in the back but OK. It's been about 15 minutes and a lady catches me watching and she tells me I can have a seat and they will bring my food out to me. So I have a seat for about 6 minutes. I then ask a guy who is handing out the orders, ""how much longer will it be?"" he then asks the one who took my order if she working on the Veggie Bowl, she replies ""she is"" talking about the other worker that is stir frying the veggies. Then, everyone continues on without answering my question, including the lady that appeared to be the manager (she was doing the least amount of work even though the place was busy). At that point, after paying almost $8, I JUST WALKED OUT! I didn't even ask for a refund! I bailed. Why? Cause this joint was an EPIC fail in my book.

For those of you who have not been to a Japanese BBQ, think of those AYCE Korean BBQ places, but with better cuts of meats that are individually laid out on a tray rather than plopped in a bowl.  

I arrived earlier than my group, so I sat at the bar for a beer.  The happy hour was $2.50 draft beers and I took full advantage of it!  Our group sat at a booth - they've designed the restaurant to maximize booth space, cause you know, no one likes to sit close to a stranger.  They also air vents built right into the grill, so all the smoke gets sucked out before it even floats upwards.  Now, while you won't go home reeking of smoke, you also won't get the delightful smells of BBQ here as well.  

We ordered two of their group sets, which I love.  It takes the work of picking the individual meats and sides out of my hands.  Food just magically appears!

Overall, I highly recommend Gyu-Kaku if you're looking for a nice place to have a BBQ dinner.",1,2JDWKHpR0g4QA4MHmFDprg

This is a rare spot in the city and if you like fine chocolate, definitely try it. I love that they add savory flavors to the chocolate (olive, cedar and on and on)

Skewers ranges from $2.99 - $6.99. Most items have the same flavour; salt, chili pepper, and cumin. Every item started tasting the same after the first two or three skewers. It masks the natural flavours of the ingredients. 

Similar to other reviewers, my favorite is the Enokitake mushroom skewer and Korean Cabbage. My family did not enjoy any of the meat skewers. They felt lamb skewers lacked the gamey flavour of lamb, beef skewers lacked the earthy flavour of beef. Lastly, chicken gizzard and squid tentacles skewers were very tough.

I have been to two spas for a total of two times, so I am no connoisseur. Both times have been couples massages with my girlfriend, wherein we have undergone treatments and regular use of facilities. What I do consider myself very seasoned in, however, is customer service and analyzing operations, as I would hope my reviews would reverberate.

This day was a very special day, as is any day that begins with me at a spa. We were celebrating my girlfriend's birthday, and a daylong spa adventure was just what we needed.

We arrived promptly at 9:30am for our 10am massages, and were greeted by a few very cheerful spa staff, who, with my quick mention while making the reservations a week ago, wished my girlfriend a happy birthday, and we were on our way to our respective locker rooms. I received the quick rundown of the facilities by a very professional gentleman who appeared to be one of the managers. It was 9:35am and it was time for pleasure.

I quickly slipped into something more relaxing and explored the facilities. The inviting hot tub with a very picturesque desert mural adorning the wall set my spa adventure in motion. I exited the healing waters before I got too wrinkly, and walked a few short steps to the large vacant steam room. With each breath I became more relaxed. Inhaling the hot steam, exhaling the accumulation of toxins from my lungs, and best of all, not having a glimmer of thought about work--the ultimate relaxation. After the beading turned into profuse perspiration, I rinsed off in one of the multiple waterfall showers, and relaxed in the room, where I turned on Pioneer Woman and waited for my massage therapist, drinking organic limeade, and wishing I had time to cook brisket like Ree Drummond.

My massage went just as expected, and I emerged a much more tenderized version of myself, primed for some grill marks in the late afternoon Arizona sun. We retired to our respective locker rooms, and again I went through the hot tub and steam room routine as I chugged the cucumber-infused water. I was disappointed there wasn't a private pool specifically for spa patrons. The Hyatt Regency Gainey Ranch has a FABULOUS private mineral pool, which holds a competitive advantage over the Agave Spa. Nevertheless, we walked across the sidewalk to the 'adult pool', adjacent to the Kierland pool complex, and were immediately greeted by some highly attentive staff members. I believe Chris was our attendant, and he did a wonderful job in ensuring we were both properly hydrated, with our Long Islands and Mojitos never running out. He was very professional in his speech, and overhearing him converse with his colleagues, he seemed to be a team player. Kudos to him.

The 'adult pool' left a lot to be desired. It was really just a hole in the ground. No waterfalls, no swim-up bar, no cool grotto areas. Just plain. Again, a far reach from the facilities at the Hyatt Regency Gainey Ranch, but the service in this area was its saving grace. 

After a few drinks and some nap time, we eventually made our way to the pool complex complete with a lazy river and slide. Again, service here was great and Leslie was very quick to assist us with whatever we needed. Consider adding french fries as an automatic side for the cheeseburger. I can imagine 90% of your customers wonder where the fries are when their cheeseburger arrives. The facilities were fun, and the lazy river was a nice touch as well!

In conclusion, the spa facilities are very good, but the service helps to carry the Agave Spa as a contender for top spas in the Valley. Please send my regards to the aforementioned associates who helped make our day highly enjoyable.",3,ZqO2776PGEMZRjsX-mfXNw

I felt like a little kid in a candy store when I first stepped in here and didn't even know where to begin with the crazy large selection of food from Asian to Mexican to Italian..you name it!

I loved their sweet potato tots, steamed crab, Japanese ramen, dim sum...well I basically loved it all...Oh, and I loved the drink selection they had right by the fried food with fresh HORCHATA, pineapple juice, and many more in these cute, individual glass jars (it's the little things!)

And don't even get me started on the desserts! Ahh, these are the times I wish my stomach was bigger so I could try everything, but unfortunately, by the time I was eating desserts, my stomach felt like it was going to explode.  Still, from what I managed to stuff in my mouth before feeling sick, my favorites were the Black sesame mochi, sticky toffee ice cream, macarons, and build your own CREPES...my mouth is watering at the thought! 

The wait is reallyyyy long here, especially on the weekends (I know someone who waited 5 hours!) so try coming for an early lunch/dinner or be prepared to wait! I think you can give them your phone number, and go do your own thing, then they'll call you back when it's time so you don't have to stand in line the whole time which is a plus!

I had contacted the dealership about an online listing for a Durango that we were interested in yesterday morning. While that car wasn't available anymore, Thomas was dedicated in finding me a great fit for my needs. Within minutes of talking to him, I was being emailed multiple listings of vehicles that were not only what I needed size wise, but price wise as well. Thomas had the SUV we agreed on brought to this location, and set up a time that worked with my hectic schedule to take a look at it - all on the same day! He even gave us the option to do our credit check online before going in to save us time. 

The dealership closes at 9pm and we showed up around 7pm and Thomas was there waiting for us with my car-to-be pulled up front. We took it for our test drive and he was very polite and talked with us the entire time and unlike our other test drives, this one wasn't an awkward silence the entire time. When we were done he had all of our paperwork ready to go and the price we were looking for. He stayed with us until everything was said and done - which was around 11:15pm, and explained every detail of my new car to me. 

Thomas is an incredible salesman and put every one of my needs first and found me an incredible car that will suit my family's needs for years to come. 

If you're considering shopping at this dealership, I would highly recommend asking for Thomas; you won't be disappointed!

Went with two other couples and having heard the place was typically busy, we went early-6:00 and planned on putting our name in for a bay and then have dinner while we waited.  This worked our perfectly.   We ordered our food and very shortly after we were done eating, we got the text that our bay was ready.  Note that each player needs to buy a $5 dollar players card which is good forever and is how the game play works.  You load the card with money and swipe it in at your booth.  Make sure what line you are in when you enter so you don't end up standing in a line that you didn't need to be in, they have kiosks for the cards.

So, for the food, surprisingly it was really good.  Between the group, we had a pretty good mix of plates on the table and everyone was really happy with their order.  I had the basic cheeseburger- but there was a cobb salad, club sandwich and a few other dishes- all the main dishes ran about $10 ish.  

The wait staff was on top of all our needs the entire time and let me tell you the place was packed!

Game time- we were in a bay on the second floor and had a couch, there are some bays that have tall tables but I think either would be comfortable for a group.  They did have heaters that you control in your bay if needed-we did not. 

 There are several games you can choose to play, all varying around lighted/colored circles out in the range.  You pay per hour and we played two hours.  The price varies depending on the time of day, for us it was $45 per hour for the bay.

We both got the green chile stew for our entrees, my husband enjoyed it, I thought it was a bit on the sweet side, especially as it cooled off.

As we wandered around in the dark looking for the restaurant, it felt like we were in an episode of the Twilight Zone. Lots of businesses closed, vacant buildings, and no other people walking around. Very creepy.

After wandering around for at least 20 minutes, we finally found the place. We stood for some time, waiting to be acknowledged by the staff to be seated. A female server finally took notice of us. We told the server we were there for the wine tasting, but would like to sit and have dinner as well. She told us to sit anywhere and pointed to where the wine tasting was being held in the restaurant. She didn't even bother to give us a menu. She hurried to seat the patrons that were behind us in line and gave them menus. We were irritated and offended, so we left. 

Avoid this establishment like the plague. I can't believe this establishment treats patrons this way. You would think they would appreciate any patronage they can get, considering many of the businesses at Lake Las Vegas have gone out of business.

1) Because it's the best drinking spot with variety and low prices near my house. Proximity is important. 
2) They have an extensive outdoor seating area so on nice evenings it is perfect. They also have some yard games. 
3) It's just a very laid back environment. The bar staff is helpful and friendly. You can bring food with you and no one is going to make a stink about it (a friend and I showed up with a pizza, not a word). 
4) To reiterate the prices you can't beat. 
5) ANNND the variety is insane. For beer they have a room temp area to choose from, and you can throw it in their chiller. Or they have a fridge of already chilled beer (smaller selection), as well as several options on tap. Then, if you're more of a wine enthusiast, they have a decent selection of wine as well.

I PROMISE TO PUT PICTURES SOON (done 564-570)
STAFF: all are super friendly, and always have a smile on their face. Manager came by (Jax) she was nice chatted a bit. Hostesses, our waiter Michael took care of us.
They go a little too much into detail about what they are doing; I mean I don't really need to hear a lecture on condiments or what they recommend we do with the ginger or soy sauce, unnecessary chatter.
BATHROOM: why? because which bathroom do you know has mouthwash to rinse your stinky onion and garlic chip breath after eating here? They do, cute setup.
COST/VALUE: Its moderately priced; some yelpers say its cheap or less than the norm, maybe if you eat 5pcs of sushi and drink ice water. But if you have an appetite, and drink, minimum youll blow is 50/person, so again not high not low average price.
FOOD: When I eat sushi, I look at 4 things: 1)quality of fish 2)taste  3) presentation  4) originality
Taste ===4.5 stars
Presentation=4.5 stars
quality of fish =4.5 stars
originality=6 stars (yes six out of 5)

Heres what I ordered:
Tsukijji express: tuna ok, with avocado, just a standard item.
Agemaki=deep fried with yellow tail, cilantro and asparagus, very good. Loved the black and orange colored sauce next to it. Actually their sauces are great, each dish seems to have its own one.
Mushroom wakame soup=order this soup. has 3 kinds of mushrooms in it, a tasty fish/musroom oily broth just amazing. Liked soup more than anything yes that good.
Crudo=candied quinoa (not enough on it though should put a lot more) on top of sea bass, tasted awesome, with bursting cut heirlooms in the mix.
Atlantic salmon with citrus slices underneath, I know sounds gross...until you eat it, wowzerz, good stuff.
Suika Sakana=favorite and most original item. Who would put slices of jalapeno on top of tuna, then put chopped watermelon blocks underneath it, and make an ocean out of the plate base with basil oil? Just heavenly. Their fruits are super fresh and crisp.
Fried chicken bits=only item I didn't care for; chicken needs to be fried in a better method, it was very bland tasting chicken, even with the jalapeno slices and thin onion slices. doesn't taste fried, like the chili sauce they mixed with but doesn't save the chicken. Skip this.
Oh, they gave complimentary cantaloupe shot, wasn't crazy about that should be chilled but didn't mind it, nice gesture.
Downed meal with 2 Asahi Blacks...excellent beer and frigid as always like all Japanese RR's.
If your staying in las vegas, this MUST be on your checklist.
Shockingly close, just take (from strip) flamingo and go up to past the 15 N/S ramps, keep going about 1-2 miles its on the left side after decateur, very easy to find, but be sharp. There is a separate lightless left turn that turns you right into the small lot. DO IT, don't think go there, and enjoy a great quiet tasty fruit and funky flavor-infused night.

so, bottom line, I give the place for the food 4.5 stars, and the smiling faces make it 5. Minor flaws which are easily overlooked even by a sushi snob like me.",1,3YK7REruC4FwDTOj8zUYcQ

I really enjoy the facials and the extractions are thorough. I pre book my appointments in advance as they can get pretty busy if you're wanting a weekend appointment. The facial prices are pretty reasonable and much cheaper than any high end spa that charges exorbitant prices that don't do anything for your face. I've been getting facials since 2003 (starting in Vancouver) and the I expect them to have extremely painful extractions and thorough cleansing. I don't like the quick cleansing, half assed massages, throw on a mask and leave the room type. They're hands on for every single step. Expect an arm and hand massage while your face is getting steamed, and then an upper back and shoulder massage while your mask sets.

A year later, this extremely successfully sushi joint was sold to someone else and the glory days were over. Another year later, a place called Charlie's Lunch Box opened in a different plaza - the cheap sushi and lunch bentos were a hit and about a year or two later, the place was sold and the glory again ended.

Yes the sushi is cheap - about $4 per roll, all pre-made and placed in little boxes at the front. The prices are good for what you get, but the experience was just not the same anymore.

We picked up our Bernese mountain dog puppy at two months of age. Our breeder recommended Lorenzo's dog training, specifically Nick, because her son's dog had been trained by him. She had nothing but good things to say about him, so we took down his information and kept it in the back of our minds for later down the road. However, it turned out that living in an apartment in Boston makes for a very difficult time training a puppy. After three weeks with the puppy, we realized we were in over our heads and needed some help. We both work full time and wanted our dog to have the best training available in order to live a good, healthy lifestyle. Long story short, we ended up sending our puppy, Opie, with Nick for four weeks. We were very hesitant and nervous, not only because we were going to be without him, but we we didn't know what to expect. Nick did his best in explaining what he would work on with Opie, etc, but we were still nervous. Within days of Opie being with Nick, I felt more at ease. Nick sent pictures, videos, and texts daily to assure me that Opie was in good hands. We met once a week to go over everything Opie had learned. Not only did he seem much more behaved but he seemed happier. Having structure in his life made him be able to better adapt. It was evident that Nick enjoyed his job and didn't think of it as ""work"". He truly had fun training Opie. We are currently at week three of training, with one week left, and with the training sessions, videos, and pictures I am already so happy with Nick's work. I sent my breeder a video of Opie training and she was amazed. I cannot recommend Nick enough and I am truly thankful for his time and effort.",0,RQOhB_H8CNeU9C-9tEIN2g

The restaurant is tucked inside of the Pointe Inn motel, around the corner from front desk and down a hall. Popped in and it was packed. They made a table for us near the door, to fit us in, or the wait would have been an hour.

Started with the Thai iced tea to cool us down. Freaking delicious. Iced tea topped with evaporated and coconut milk mixed in. We got down to ordering:
chicken skewers with peanut satay sauce - decent.
tom yum goong - everything you want your tom yum to be.
pineapple fried rice - too oily, had no pineapple, tasted like fried rice.
green curry eggplant - tasty
red curry chicken - very bold flavors and we finished this one quick

overall the portions were very generous. The sauces were delicious, made in house and the highlights of the meal. The food itself was a bit bland, undercooked and off. Most of it relied heavily on sauces. Given the amount of people dining at the hour, they must have been really rushing so I would definitely give this place another go, as other reviews and the awards on their counter speak for their usual experience.",4,7_EXcW2umdoi9T8KpjqrDA

He swore it was one of his favorite local sushi spots, being a sushi fanatic, I had to try it, instantly became a fan. I'd drive through here for dinner or make the trip though I live a ways away haha. I brought some coworkers here and it's become a favorite lunch spot as we work near by on the strip for 20.95.

Sakana has almost ruined me for other sushi spots, with the exception of Neko, which I suspect is under the same ownership/ management, overall very similar rolls. Their sauce combinations and spiciness have left me a bit unsatisfied, as if their ingredients are missing, from other places. They have a wide variety of fish options and offer an extended menu of rice less options during dinner $25.95

This little local Vegas gem brings some serious AYCE competition, one of the best. They usually have a wait but I've never waited too long whether I sit with coworkers at lunch or I sit at the bar, chefs are quick too. The roll and appetizer variety is plentiful, they offer exclusive dinner menu specials which is totally worth the dinner price. They offer a good selection of rice less rolls and options. They aren't thinly sliced on the fish, which I love about their nigiri, and their sauces are always just the right amount to complement the flavor.",0,NcUMNz6tAahD6mDmuKwYIA

It's been a fun ride, and I wanted to do something different that most Yelpers wouldn't do. As the owners know, I've been writing reviews every month to accurately reflect how a tenant's stay is here on a regular, recorded basis. Gables did NOT pay me to do this, there was never an agreement, it was just something I decided I wanted to do when I first moved in here.

OK, so now with that disclaimer out of the way... Here's the monthly breakdown summary. 

June 2016 -- 5/5
Honeymoon phase. Moved into a B2 unit. ATTACHED garage is a HUGE plus. Very spacious closets, the ""his and hers"" walk-in closet is a neat idea. Spacious kitchen, spacious bedrooms, space architecture is well designed. You can thank Mark Taylor for that when they built this place (property now managed by Gables). Pool is awesome, music plays until 10 pm at the pool. Gym is open 24/7. Yoga on certain days. Business center is open 24/7. I have gone in there to do work when COX fails in my apartment (because COX is crap, but I digress...)

July 2016: -- 3/5
Wow, that $500 energy bill. Look, I get that this is Phoenix and I also get that Gables has no control over the energy company, but what Gables DOES have some limited say in is the facility infrastructure. The buildings here just don't hold air conditioning very well.

August 2016 -- 3/5
Still a high energy bill. Also had my son during this month, so imagine the panic I had when the AC broke down. Luckily maintenance was here within hours, but during that time I pulled the trigger on buying a portable AC... Which brought down the energy bill but meant that my son & I were quarantined to two rooms.

September 2016 -- 4/5
Phew, that energy bill went back down. I tried the grille for the first time. LOVED it. Maintenance does a good job cleaning up not just the grilles but the surrounding grass. Let's be real, any apartment you go to, dog owners are terrible at picking up their doggie doo. This is not a problem isolated to Desert Club. People are assholes. Also, the people that slam the garbage door outside the master bedroom at unit 1137. Luckily, maintenance found a creative way to reduce the noise output when one closes the door. This is when I begin to realize that Gables is pretty on top of their game.

October 2016 -- 5/5
I turned 27, but with a son, you don't really go out to party. Had a drink at home, and experienced mosquitoes outside. Like another reviewer pointed out, in the B2 unit, you can't really get natural air ventilation in the living room, cuz the only source of natural air is a french door with no screen... Mosquitoes everywhere! Gables did a great job with pest control spraying down the property perimeter, proper good job to the staff!

November 2016 -- 5/5
I quit working for Sprouts and began working for Amazon.com. I am so sorry, Gables for all the increased number of packages that came in from Amazon.com under Unit 1137. You have done a fine job entering in all those email notifications sent to us for each package that came in. I just checked Amazon.com, I ordered close to 100 packages at this point in the lease. No idea how you did it but you did.

December 2016 -- 5/5
More packages! Gables found a lost dog and did the right thing emailing the community asking who the dog owner was. Not sure if they ever found the owner, I hope they did. Kudos to Gables. Also, holiday party with lots of different dinner entree and even dessert options, unless I'm remembering incorrectly now... It's been too long now.

January 2017 -- 5/5
Trump is now President but Gables is still awesome. Packages from Amazon.com continue to come in. Gables hosted a brunch! Also, fitness center got fix flooring. Further proof that Gables is awesome in their upkeep and maintenance. New gym looks awesome. Also, 24/7 gym still since day 1.

February 2017 -- 5/5
Gables hosted brunch on a Sunday! That was pretty cool to see residents from different buildings come together for some coffee and doughnuts and bagels. Also they had painters come out to freshen up the exterior look, so that was neat.

March 2017 -- 4/5
Some service requests got put in for some broken lights. Gables jumped all over it, and resolved the issue via mitigation, so that was cool. Also new pedestrian gates got installed in the community, so that was neat.

April 2017 -- 5/5
BBQ! Nothing else needs to be said.

May 2017 -- 5/5
Here I am!

OTHER STUFF:
Like other reviewers have stated, the facility infrastructure is dated, so this impacts tenants primarily in two ways: high energy bills in the hottest months of the year in Phoenix, and noisy floors when neighbors above you are stomping on their floors. Fire alarms go off when you use the oven (other tenants have stated),

I agree with most of the things that previous reviewers have mentioned. 

Pros: clean (especially sauna and locker rooms), new cardio equipment and weights, lots of free class options (with membership), personable and qualified staff (some of them), hot yoga room (option for heating), TV options on most cardio machines

Cons: class schedule continuously changes (every 1-3 months), all instructors/trainers aren't awesome (some consistently start class late or aren't as organized or energetic as others), unprofessional emails (but it's a gym, so this isn't high on my list although it REALLY annoyed me at first), microphones/sound system in classrooms don't always work

What can you say that hasnt already been said about this beautiful hotel? Every detail has been articulately designed and polished which is consistant with the level of service you will get. The rooms are lovely and CLEAN. I have spent many days in high-end hotels and I like how they maintain cleanliness at the Wynn. 

The casino is also very good and quite busy, including the Poker Room, which I spent a hefty amount of time in. I guess when you join the tables around 3am, you should expect a bunch of guys loaded with booze and cash. My favorite type of opponents. Needless to say, I was among my own. Trashed. The highlight was that part of the hotel has room elevators that are adjacent to the Poker Room, so you can spend plenty of time watching the club-goers and hooker hunters walk back to their rooms with their night's ""winnings"". And for some, I do use the word ""winnings"" loosely.

SW, the fine-dining restaurant located near the lobby was also quite luxurious. The rib-eye was fantastic, foie gras amazing, beet salad wonderful and the duck impeccable. The highlight here, is that they have a light, video show about every half-an-hour that was borderline acid-trip and live art. Was entertaining to say the least, with my favorite being two extremely large, mechanical flowers that danced to the beat over the waterfall. Much kudos go out to Steve for creating such a great and beautiful hotel in his own vision of what a Vegas hotel should be. Extravagant, elegant, sublime and chic.",2,NvgRrWYgBHGbIVbHf0ZCeQ

Step 1- Cab company receives a call

Step 2- Cab company answers call and gives a time for wait for a cab driver

Step 3. Cab comes and picks up passenger. 

I would give classy Cab an A+ at step 1. They masterfully answered my phone call within 5 rings. They demonstrated great skill in the first step. 

Step 2- They said that a cab will be there to pick me up at my desired location within 10 minutes (mind you this is a cold winter day with wind chill temperatures in the sub 0 range). I say great and hang up the phone. 

At this point I am fairly excited to quickly or at least somewhat quickly get out of the cold outside. 

10 minutes goes by... No Cab.... 15 minutes goes by.... No cab.... Uh oh, step 3 is running 5 minutes late.

No big deal, i'll just give them another call, maybe something got lost between step 2 and 3 and a phone call can quickly fix it. 

Again, they nailed step 1 totally answered my phone call, and then assured me that the cab would be there any minute.  ""it is in the area and dispatched."" I thank them again. 

By this point my fingers are getting so cold it is difficult to operate phone but I am still excited to get out of the cold and get to my destination...

10 more minutes goes by (25 minutes into the ""10 minute wait"") I call back again. The operator assures me that cab will be there any second. I have no gloves no hat, maybe I should start walking

My destination is only 3 or 4 miles away, I start thinking of alternative ways to get myself out of the cold...

I walk half a block to the nearest gas station to head inside for shelter... At this point I am about 40 minutes into my 10 minute subarctic wait. Classy cab has my phone number and has assured me that they will call when their driver is getting close. But no call and still no cab.

Now I am starting to get a little desperate. 

At this point it is almost an hour into my wait and very clear that I will not be getting a Classy Cab ride. 

So to keep things classy at 31 years of age I start asking random people at the gas station for a ride. This feels really great, I feel like I am 15 years old and asking my friend's parents for a ride home from a football game, except I am a grown man, I don't know these people, and they look at me like I might be a murderous hitchhiker. 


The workers at the gas station watch my shameful attempts to bum a ride. I decide that since this place is keeping me warm, I should probably buy something so I can attempt to keep some shred of dignity. I walk around the store find a nice ice tea that I don't want to buy, take it up to the register and apologize for my actions

At this point the awesome worker takes pity on me and agrees to drive me my 4 mile trip for $20... Totally fair price in my opinion. I lock in the deal and off we go to my destination.

Classy cab never calls and never shows up....

We upgraded to a room with a view of the strip, opened the window, and there was the Eiffel Tower. Pow! The pool is lovely, although a bit chilly this time of year. The street walk (inside) really does remind me of Paris, although the prices are too high. I was looking for quality croissants or French rolls, and didn't find them, sadly. 

With the upgrade we got continental breakfast and drinks and ""appetizers"" at night. We felt that was a great bargain because the night food became our dinner. And two drinks apiece per night was plenty. The breakfast was plenty, too, with yogurt, fruit and cheese, bagels and lox, and so on. Much more than ""continental"" suggests.

The worst thing about the Paris is the Frankie Valli music in the elevators--yuck! After listening to that ad nauseum, I would never see ""Jersey Boys.""

The second worst is the loud, pounding music that hit our room until 4:30 am (!), and we were on the 21st floor (!!!). My husband called to complain, and he was told the hotel's president made the decision to allow the loud booming until 4:30. For that reason, we could not stay here again.

We love the option to use the kid area pool or the adult area pool depending on how crowded either one is. The spa in the kids area is large enough that you can sit and have a conversation with your spouse without feeling like you're sitting right on top of the people next to you (large enough for 70 people we're told). The rooms are perfect for the essentials, you have a fully functional kitchen, which is amazing. The bathrooms are spacious and the water pressure in the shower is always great (this is a big deal for me, I hate not being able to get the shampoo out of my hair or getting shot in the eye with a stray stream of water). The adult area pool has a great little bar, and the prices aren't bad. Best part of that is being able to charge it to the room so you don't have to bring your CC to the pool. Great little gym on property. Gorgeous scenery if you want to walk around. Lots of day trips available for a price. There is an actual spa attached to the resort, and I'm sure the treatments are wonderful, but I feel they are a bit pricey. 
My husband loves being able to check out bbq tools and we will usually bbq a nice steak one of the nights we are there. The people at the front desk are always very helpful and if there is an issue with your room they can usually send someone right up.

The last time I was here was with my best friend, who had befriended the bartender and demanded that I tag along and enjoy the drinks that the two of the came up with. Well, us not caring about pop sport culture did not know it was a game night, and so struggled to find seats at the bar. Her friend the bartender took a while to get us our drinks, which was fine since he had to service the whole place. But then came the food fiasco. First, it took fifteen minutes for us to put in our order. Then it took twenty minutes for the order to go through. Which isn't all that bad considering, but the thing was, we only ordered appetizers. I got fried pickles and she got the sampler plate. I was approached by a waiter with two baskets of fried pickles who asked me if I had order some. I said yes, and they gave me a basket. Turns out the people next to us had ordered two baskets of fried pickles. I basically just jacked their pickles.
I didn't know this until much, much, much later when my friend got her plate and they gave me another basket of fried pickles. The bill was only for one as well. I seriously hope those people didn't end up paying for two.

I ordered a cosmopolitan. It was not good. And I had to ask for the lemon twist. Once we were seated we had to ask for a wine list, we were handed a glass wine list and were told they did not have moscato by the glass. Then, we had to ask for a by the bottle list. We ordered a bottle of white wine and were then brought the wine, in an ice bucket, and  were informed they don't keep that particular wine chilled so we would have to wait for it to chill. Weird. We ordered several appetizers and entrees to share. All were delicious but we weren't given any explanation as to what everything was.

CONS- no indoor track , I don't like treadmills at all. I prefer personal exertion and not being guided by a belt lol

- the ""gymindation"" signs everywhere ( basically saying that you cant make grunting noises or drop weight or wear string tank tops because it can make members feel uncomfortable ?!

The beloved display windows of Sonic Boom are redone momentarily, and feature absolutely stunning large scale recreations of recently released album covers. The artist(s) who put these together is truly remarkable, and it's always worth a stop to see when a new display is put up.

Beyond the exterior, Sonic Boom is great.

There are days when I'm starving and wishing I could drive the six hours to Phoenix and have Four Peaks for lunch. I don't know why, but the food there is tops for a brewpub. It's not super gourmet like those participating in this gastropub movement as of late, but it's solid comfort all the way. I'm particularly addicted to their beer-battered chicken tenders and their fries (seasoned wedges) are like crack. They've got decent fish and chips (although they don't hold a candle to George and Dragon) and the other stuff's good too. 

Beer-wise, Four Peaks doesn't make the cut on my list of favorite breweries in the country, but for Arizona, it's okay. The Kiltlifer (not to be confused with Moylan's Kilt Lifter (which rates higher on BeerAdvocate) from California, and the less popular Pike's Kilt Lifter from Seattle, seems to be their most popular brew and is a pretty standard and consistent Scotch ale with just the right amount of malt and yeast. 

Other offerings include their 8th Street Ale (average), Hefeweizen (below average), and their Hop Knot IPA (which is inconsistent-- sometimes it's very hoppy, sometimes it's just got no bite at all). They have a Raja IPA which is also inconsistent-- sometimes it has no difference from the Hop Knot whatsoever, but when you do get a batch that tastes different, it's a little comparable to Lagunitas'  Hop Stupid. 

The Oatmeal Stout and Pumpkin Porter are laughable. Just cheap knock offs of better breweries, although the Stout does make a decent milkshake. And the Arizona Peach used to be a summer fave of mine up until I got a pint that tasted entirely of wheat...gross. 

It gets packed here, but they've got tons of space and a decent happy hour. Tons of Tempe locals, but worth the visit if you're in the area. Is this the best local brewery in the greater Phoenix area? Of course...but there isn't really much competition, now is there?",0,gvyYZgFdBbcT3xGjWOvZag

My little Joe's Deli on Madison and 117th was closed due to a death in the family( AND IS CLOSING FOR GOOD COME NOVEMBER)  so I drove on looking for""  food adventure""  while trying to keep my money in Lakewood, I ventured over to El Jalapeno's...also closed for Cinco De Juli :0) 
Just kidding, but it was closed. So I thought Ok, let's give Dianna's  place another chance.

BIG MISTAKE! if you actually LIKE food, LIKE good service, LIKE cleanliness DO NOT eat here...keep driving, probably to the Diner on Clifton, Geppetto's or Corky and Lenny's on Chagrin! 

Dianna's was a food nightmare, like Jurassic Park for food!

 First off the manager was an absolute, disorganized, disheveled joke. He looked like he was texting a fart joke to a buddy before he cared to acknowledge us. He finally put his phone down and grabbed our menus and then was searching a mostly empty restaurant to figure out where to sit TWO people.

 The waitress was unhelpful, just totally uninterested in answering our simple menu questions. We ordered ice tea, made from a mix, but what was worse was she never bothered to refill it. the entire time. The place was about 1/3 full.

We looked over the menu and decided on our two meals and decided due to the hour to go with lunch. A. Chicken Ceaser salad  WITHOUT croutons and a shrimp alfredo that came with soup and salad.

 My daughter  received her cup of minestrone meatball soup promptly. It was tasty, her salad showed up at the same time. I had nothing

After that we continued to sit there for nearly 45 minutes. I  still had nothing to eat. NO tea refills and NO acknowledgement that the food was coming or even that they were maybe understaffed that day...meanwhile  orders were going out to what I can only assume were a handful of Burly ""regulars"" . (They must be family members.)

 I  was ready to complain when our food FINALLY showed up!

 I ORDERED a Ceaser salad, what I GOT was a CHEF'S salad with over cooked, over salted, processed chicken thrown on top, an old egg that was sliced and had a GREY yolk, piled high with  the croutons I requested be left off and some faux-ceaser dressing.My daughter was just speechless. The teen is no snob, but she knows food AND she heard my order.  

Her food was no better, poorly cooked pasta, mushy. The attempted cream sauce was an ""Epic Fail"" and the shrimp were cooked to a mush. despite appearing pretty at first..

It took me 7 minutes to get the ""manager's"" attention, I was standing there as he rang out 1 victim, sorry patron. I asked him to come look at the food we were served.

 I TRIED NOT to blame the waitress,I know she didn't cook it but WHERE WAS A  REFILL!

Fortunately the owner was standing there. I showed her the food  and she made lots of apologies saying  ""it was SO unusual"".. I doubt that.

.I went to chef's school back in the 90's. I can eat in "" holes in the wall"" , street food, I can eat at LOLA,  The Russian Tea Room or Maxim's. All I ask is that the food ,no matter how simple or eleborate, is cooked properly and don't hand just any idiot a spatula. I think the dishwasher must have cooked that day.

I should have known better when I saw another family walk out (before we were dumb enough to walk IN ) and head to Wendy's across the street.

The only GOOD thing was, despite my still offering to pay for our tea and my daughter's food.  They comped the entire disaster and said please give them another chance....

We stared with the beef empanada which was tasty. Came with half the verde sauce and half the mole sauce on top, and while tasty, I wish would have been on the side because it took away from the soft crunch I was looking for in the empanada pastry. 

I ordered four tacos- bistec, rajas, barbacoa, and chorizo. To my surprise, the rajas packed the most flavor but all were very well done. The tacos were double layered (I guess this is authentic Mexican style? I approve!) with corn tortillas, a scoop of rice, cilantro, and salsa.  

My girlfriend got the enchiladas in the verde sauce. This came with rice and a zucchini/ squash medley. The enchiladas seemed a bit on the small side. She got one chicken, one beef and one cheese. The most disappointing thing was that the chicken and beef ones didn't have any cheese on them at all! This made for a rather dry and flavor-lacking experience. Honestly, the cheese one was the best one. 

We also had the house marg for $5 which was very good as well. Complimented the dishes nicely. I could see some people claiming it was on the weaker side, but I'm not a big tequila guy so it was fine to me!

While I'm thrilled with the recent (read: up to 5 years old) interest in teas, the rise in over-scented and novelty flavoured teas have irked me as a casual tea enthusiast. 

The traditional knowledge of Assamese, Korean or Sri Lankan Tea as far back as thousands of years is not to be compared with tea kitschily-titled Christmas Cuddles and Chocolate Hugs for the middle-aged midwestern Folgers lover. 

This is why I was very apprehensive of trying out T-Buds, as a tea emporium, particularly in this area. I'm so happy to write that I was extremely surprised with the results. 

T-Buds is a very cute tea cafe with a very well executed food pairing menu. Along with their very long list of traditional teas, they serve lattes and other specialty drinks. They also have a wide range of crepes, traditional afternoon tea snacks and salads. 

I tried the Assamese Malt tea with a savory crepe, the name of which I can't recall, but its quite safe to say that the savory crepes are well worth it. The tea was delicious and the service was fantastic. I didn't have to request extra hot water at any point.

I will return and in the meantime recommend T-Buds to all of my friends. Make sure you make a reservation, though. Try the Darjeeling, Japanese Sencha and the Puerh teas. You'll thank me for it.

When saw a picture in new times with a half dozen Rogue taps, I knew I had to go. We decided to wait until they had been open a few days and could get the hang of things.

So, Sunday night we drove all the way up to the north suburbs into some sterile power center with all the usual suburban crap. I was overly delighted to see pictures of downtown Phoenix all over the place. There are probably a couple dozen photoshopped shots around the restaurant. It definitely made me feel like it was at least not 100% a carbon copy chain restaurant, even though it is a chain, but it's probably franchised. 

The wings I would not order again. The quality of them seemed to be fine, and they were baked rather than deep fried, but they were so small that it made me feel a little ripped off. They were about 1/2 the size of the wings from NYPD and about 1/3 the size of Streets of New York's. I then ordered the Rogue Chocolate Stout and the girlfriend ordered a Rogue Juniper Ale, both on draft, along with just about everything else, including Chimay tripple... nice! Pizza was a Kosmik Karma, which was a vegetarian pizza and was tasty enough, but was a completely average pizza. Nothing was crispy, nothing was jumping out at me, but it was edible. I'd had much worse. 

The place is VERY chaotic. It's loud, busy, and has people running around everywhere. And, as you'd imagine on the northside, there are plenty of white trash families running around, lots of 15 year old girls in skate shoes and famous stars and stripes hoodies, and lots of lifted trucks. Be prepared to eat with a lot of douches. Service was excellent, though. I'd return if I were in the area, and while it's nice to have something to fall back on in that situation, I wouldn't go out of my way to go back since really the only draw for me are the beers.",1,sjWvk3DZapZ-9ULAFtDmYw

Downtown Cleveland is a ghost town and this really hurts the hotels in the neighborhood.  If you like theater, this hotel is located adjacent to Playhouse Square so it's very convenient in that aspect.

The super cheapo rate I received when I booked this hotel.  There's nothing like a HUGE bargain when traveling.

The chef's signature pasta.  Shrimp Fettuccine Alfredo.  Delicious.  The dinner rolls were hot and fresh and the Mixed Greens salad was to die for.

The comfy king bed was great.  The rooms could use some updating as far as electronics are concerned though.

Some things I disliked...

My breakfast was late.

I was told to set my room-service tray outside my door when I was finished eating.  It sat there for more than 24 hours, even after housekeeping serviced all the rooms on the floor.

The added gratuity on room service is 19% which is more than  sufficient and means that I shouldn't feel guilty for not leaving an EXTRA tip.  But, for some reason, I always did.

For the second half of my stay, my whole floor smelled of sewage.  Dirty, rotten, feces.  Something was backed up somewhere and the smell was even more putrid in the bathroom.  I had to keep the door closed.  Also, There was a loud banging noise above my room.  Not man-made but something in the building itself--pipes or foundation maybe.

I was all prepared to get a salad but then, then I saw the magical tortilla spinner. I couldn't resist. 

I created the business listing while I was in line, waiting for it to be my turn. Was I in line for a ride at Disneyland or to get tacos? Its decor sort of reminded me of Frontierland at D-land, but the food was definitely better quality and price than that place. 

The service was quick and to the point. The food was especially delicious, considering I fancy myself a connoisseur of quick service Mexican food. I don't think they do their meats/dairy as responsibly as Chipotle, but I could be wrong. I had never been to a Cafe Rio until yesterday, so it's all new and shiny to me.

I did like how they put ""Tips to Not Get Fat Off Our Food"" in the bottom corner of the menu. (My words, not theirs, but that's definitely what they're meaning to say.) In case you don't know, you can save food for later and not eat it in one setting. OMG GUYS, did you know that??? Did you know that you don't have to eat all the food at once? Cafe Rio definitely makes it easier, as they put lids out to make everything a to-go box if you want.

Salads came thru window fast, and intact (no rice - yay!). 2 drinks followed, with one straw (boo). Second bag was pulled before coming thru window because it contained a large number of items (car behind us?). Second bag came thru - pintos, check. Enchirito, check.

Got home - pintos with green? Nope. Red. Enchirito steak? Negative Ghost Rider. 

6 items+2 straws = 8 things to hand us. 2 of them wrong, and no straw. 5 outta 8 just isn't a good percentage. Bonus points for window girl for realizing she had wrong bag and grabbing 2nd bag ""on the fly"". Negative points for substituting incorrect items for other incorrect items.

I love the selection that the plenitude of food trucks offers.  However...  Ostensibly, the reason for operating a food truck is to reduce the cost of doing business since you don't have to pay for a building, for wait staff, for utilities, and all the other overhead costs that a traditional restaurant incurs.  You can then pass these savings on to the customer with lower-cost food.  However, the reality is that the food trucks charge MORE than traditional restaurants.  For example, I can get three tacos for $6 or $7 at Chipotle, better yet I can get two tacos around the corner at Pedro's for $3.50, so why would I want to pay $10 for three tacos from a truck?  Are they probably better than my $3.50 tacos?  Sure, but double-the-cost better?  Sadly no, there are not.  I think the food trucks get away with a little overpricing due to the food-truck hype, the novelty, and the fact that mostly all of them seem to have the same relatively inflated prices.  If each food truck was delivering exquisite gourmet delicacies, then the prices would perhaps be perfectly justified but most of them are not.  Most of them are delivering average fare, perfectly acceptable but nothing special or remarkable about it or the ingredient selection.  Given that there are tons of local places nearby serving mostly the same food for less, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to pay more for the same thing from a food truck.  The novelty of the event has somewhat of a redeeming value.  It certainly serves as an interesting thing to do for lunch to break up the daily M-F routine.  Will I go back?  I'm sure I will.  Will I leave, as usual, wondering at how little food I got for my money?  I'm sure of that, too.",4,1C4RBKxpuIQFOaBw-3brdg

My only real complaint would be that they let too many people in at one time. When we bought our tickets we were told our group would be alone. Alone in this case means working by yourselves but with other groups trying to do the same tasks so you're in each other's way constantly. 

There's a series of ""labs"" to complete and they tell you that if one is occupied to go on to the next one. Three different times I was left just standing around waiting for other people to finish. If there were less of us we would have all been done faster but because there were so many it was a little frustrating. 

I understand they want to get as many people through as they can but I would have preferred to wait a little longer and go as a smaller group rather than having to do this awkward stance where you are waiting behind someone to ensure you're next but trying not to hover over them in a way that seems pushy.

the burger - cooked medium - i'm impressed with that, but no seasoning to it - call me picky but i just feel a burger tastes better when it's seasoned while cooking as opposed to salting/peppering it after its cooked . also, the meat itself fell apart a little too easily. I still liked the burger but i liked the fries/onion rings but charge a $1 for a dipping sauce ?!? that's bullshit ! 

the malt ? needed more malt, the coconut taste not too noticeable at the beginning of the malt, but very strong at the end.

This should have actually been #179 (since my latest visit was yesterday) but apparently, I had an issue posting a draft. I visit this location quite often (especially now that the downtown location has closed for renovations and a rebranding).

I normally come in for their famous Happy Hour pricing with a $27 Love Boat for two being my staple (which, even as much as I eat, I can only eat about 1/2 to 2/3 of it) so good thing I bring my dates with me. Maybe it's because the staff recognize me/us but I always get great service and my glasses very rarely run empty (but if that should happen, they are there before I can raise my glass).

My Love Boat is always delivered with a smile and a plethora of fresh scallop (1 piece) tuna sashimi (3 pieces), salmon sashimi (3 pieces), snapper (I think) (2 pieces), salmon sushi (2 pieces), tuna sushi (2 pieces), ebi sushi (2 pieces), cucumber roll (6 pieces), California roll (6 pieces), salmon roll (6 pieces), and 5 pieces of House? roll (has tuna, salmon, imitation crab). I also get two green salad and two miso soup.

I like to also try something new with my Love Boat and last night was no exception. I tried the tuna takaki which is 4 pieces for $6 (Happy Hour pricing). I wasn't expecting much but the pieces are huge and their ponzu is pretty good (though I need to remember to ask for extra onion).

I have always like this location though parking can be challenging (there are a large number of spots but this spot is very popular).

The Lake Mead Recreation Area seemed like a good place to start.  20 minutes off the stip and you find yourself on a picturesque drive through the desert, including awesome views of the lake as you approach.  

There is a $10 fee for a car and in the recreation area itself you will find beaches, a marina, boat tours and cruises, restaurants, and trails for hiking.   Intresting eco-friendly reminder by the ticket lane that states styrofoam and glass are illegal in Lake Mead.

Visit the marina first where you are treated to sights of HUGE fish swimming freely in the lake (fishing is not allowed).  A convenience store in the marina itself allows you to buy food for the fish (apparently, you can shell out $1.50 for a bag of popcorn and the fish would be all over you).   We were also lucky enough to spot (and pet) one of their resident turtles (turtle nbr 1) who was patient enough to let us hold him for a while.  

The Boat House Restaurant serves lunch and it is quite relaxing to have lunch on the outdoor patio (under a shade) while taking in the views of the marina and nearby mountains.  

The beach is nothing to write home about (rocky and muddy).  At least it is not crowded, and the water was wonderfully warm.

We were visiting family and our son was with us, we thought the family friendly Circus Circus would be perfect, but we ended up leaving early after a serious incident.

Room:  Although our room was updated it was already showing a lot of wear and tear. The furniture had stains and many scratches. TV was crooked. Leaky tub faucet and the light in the bathroom was out. Left a lot to be desired, but considering it is a budget resort, we weren't expecting much. Had clean beds, no complaints. Bell desk was quick getting our bags up to the room, but wasn't very friendly and did not help bring them in. 

Grounds: The resort is a zoo with a constant flowing sea of children. Not an issue for us, but could be a major con others. Grounds are reasonably maintained, if a little dated. There is an issue with casino and Midway location. Children are to stay out of the gaming area, but the location of the Midway is above the casino and the only access is in the middle of the gaming floor. Not only is this inconsiderate to players, it is confusing to kids. That aside, the circus acts were amusing, games were reasonably priced ($1 or so), and the operators were fun. Location not an issue with the Adventuredome as it is located at the back of the property. Lots of rides for a reasonable price if you buy a day pass. Perfect for those with kids. 

Casino: Visited when Grandma asked to babysit our son... We always enjoy the casino at here. The dealers are super friendly and they have $5 blackjack. Slots seem pretty loose. Cocktail waitresses are outgoing and fast. It should be noted that they don't use brand liquors, but drinks are still free to players. You can usually get your standard beer selection. 

Food: Restaurant variety that is able to accommodate most tastes. The buffet was your standard buffet at a decent price, but pretty limited for those diners with dietary restrictions (I'm gluten free). However, they did whip up some custom dishes for me and made sure to take special care. Our bus person was also very helpful and attentive. Despite the mediocre selection, our buffet experience was quite exceptional due to the hard working staff. 

We were having a pretty great time at Circus Circus. However, on the 3rd day of our stay that all changed...

On Wednesday, July 16th, we decided to spend the day on the Strip. Before we left, we neatened up the room, made sure our bags were closed and out of the way, all to make it easier for the housekeeper. When we got back, our room had been cleaned and seemed in order. That is, until my husband opened his bag. He had a money clip in the bottom of his bag with $600 exact. We use this as our gambling money and only remove cash in $100 increments (we're VERY meticulous). While out he realized he forgot to lock it in the safe after the previous night, but didn't think it would be an issue since it was in the very bottom of his closed, packed bag. When he checked after we got back, his money clip now only had $440 and his clothes looked as they had been moved. Nothing else in the room was disturbed. If someone broke into our room, other things would have been gone. Someone was trying to hide it as it appeared they attempted to put everything back in place. In our minds, the only person who could have done this is the housekeeper.

We immediately called security. They said someone would be right up (took 45 minutes). The security woman apologized for the delay but was very thorough and attentive. She explained the investigation process and told us to contact risk management in the morning. We contacted them the next morning and were told there was ""nothing we can do"" and ""this is why we provide a safe"". We know we should have used the safe (honest mistake), but we should be able to trust the staff not the go through our bags and steal from us. They told us the investigation would take a minimum 10 days. We understand the process takes time but we asked if they'd do anything to help in the mean time. We still had 1 night left and this really soured our trip. No offer to make it right, no refunds, not even a real apology (just ""sorry, you should have used the safe""). Victim blaming is not an apology!

We went to the front desk to see if they would be willing to do anything. The manager there too said there was nothing they ""could"" do and offered the same ""apology"". 

We immediately checked out, went to Harrah's, and were very happy. It's a shame we couldn't even get a real apology from Circus Circus. Their loss. We go to Vegas at least twice year and have a growing family, their key demographic. Obviously, we won't be back.",17,gWoqP6blMz0nkAM_FPDSdQ

We ordered the beef pho and a chicken with Vietnamese noodle dish.  Both were perfectly seasoned and very flavorful.  The broth just seemed to be completely saturated with flavor.  I have noticed that some Vietnamese restaurants will put in too much salt in order to compensate the flavor of their soup.  That's not the case here, there's just enough seasoning to bring out the real essence of the broth.  Also, the beef was just rare enough to be soft and also add to the delicacy.

The waiters were also prompt with refilling water and packaging our food once we finished.  Even though Vietnamese cuisine isn't very complicated, it does take a bit of mastery to get done right.  This place is definitely on the top of our favorites.

The lobby of this place looks much like a small train station, it was really busy with lots of people running around and a dark lighting or the area (and nowhere to sit down). The check-in staff were reasonably good and upgraded us to a nicer room on a higher floor (15th floor). The hotel is gigantic with something like 3 or 4 sets of elevators, so finding our room was a bit of a challenge. When we got to our room however, the cleaning staff was still in the process of cleaning. We went downstairs to see if we can get a difference room. The front desk was good at correcting their mistake and gave us another room on the 12th floor (after spending 15mins on the computer and phone) but to make up for the poor planning on their part we got 2 days of complimentary parking (which is $29 a day...)

The room itself is just so-so, the carpet is old and the washroom is small (but relatively clean). The beds were comfortable, however, it was very weird walking into the room and the first thing you see is little lumps on your bed...(the lumps were just from the comforter, which was naturally shaped that way...weird) We did have a gigantic 43"" LG flat screen tv in the room, but unfortunately, there is no wireless internet in the rooms and wired is something like $14 a day. I was told that there is free wifi in the lobby, but never got a chance to use it.

For that kind of money, I think they could've made more effort, as it was two desserts (my husband and me) so why one plate? And couldn't there have been a substitution? Plus our Mon Aimee chocolate, which was also part of the price fixe dinner, was a tiny chunk. I think the kitchen must've gotten confused and thought they were serving one person.

I figured out the problem and diagnosed the issue, but I was too lazy to dig up the conduit ends where the drip line runs thru.

You gave me all the support we needed during the prenatal checks and tests, always answering all our questions. My kids loved coming to the check ups, assisting you during measurements of baby, making them feel so special, too.
I am so glad that I found you some years ago. I knew, that you are a very competent midwife, having the knowledge what to do. You helped me turn successfully my baby, so I had NO breach birth at home, even when I was not afraid to  have one in case that would have happened (as it has happened before when I lived in MD). Also knowing that you could have helped me with that, took away any fear.
Marvelys is truly the midwife anyone is looking for. Also the postpartum time with you was wonderful. You took care of assisting me to have success with breastfeeding. For the first time, I could breastfeed over 12 month. At first I had difficulties, as the baby did not gain weight so fast, but you had great tips, how to get my milk fatty, and it worked.

I have never dealt with the sales portion of the business, though I do have to say that like other reviewers, I'm definitely turned off by the hounding of the salesmen when I bring my car in for service.

I have been getting my 2004 Mazda6 serviced here for several years now, and the service experience has been generally good. Usually it's great and painless, but sometimes there have been issues, basically relating to information about services that were performed or recommended. I will say that they are a little pricy, but the mechanics I've met are knowledgeable and trustworthy, and they use genuine Mazda parts for repairs & replacements, so I'd much prefer they handle my car than someone at a random repair shop. As far as the prices, they can be somewhat mitigated by the frequent service coupons that MOSC posts on their website and sends through their emails - I use them often (mostly for % off any service, or a cheaper oil change).

But honestly, above everything else, it's the service manager, Ryan Shaffer, that keeps my business with MOSC. If I am dissatisfied or confused with a service, or if I just want more information, he is extremely knowledgeable and diligent in assisting, and he is incredibly kind as well. He is a champion of customer service and keeps standards high. Basically, if you have any misgivings about service as MOSC, don't just walk away - make sure you chat with him first!",2,Stkp_hRQdH4miuTVToW2Lw

One review that stood out to me was a neighbor saying that they're dog friendly on the patio. I called ahead to verify and they sure are! Took the 2 puppies with us and enjoyed some dining on their patio. 

We got the edamame and wings for appetizers. Both were tasty. We only ordered one entree which was the skirt steak salad. Also tasty. 

The place has beautiful decor from what I could see on the patio, looking inside. I never made it in since I had the dogs but my family all used the restroom and confirmed that it was very nice inside.

My wife and I have been here once before years ago but in the mood for diner food so we decided to give it another try. Last time as I remember was very good.

This time turned out to be a mixed bag, Some items were beyond the control and the restaurant, the other part well within their control.

It's a popular restaurant and they share a parking lot in a small strip mall with other stores so parking is woefully inadequate. Say people not only double parking but in some cases, triple parking. Ended up dropping my wife off to get in line while I parked next door in the Darby Acres  Shopping Center Parking lot and walking over.

When I walked in, my wife told me there was a 20 minute wait which was OK.  Seating for those waiting for a table or a take out order is limited so be prepared to wait.

The 20 minutes turned out to be pretty close to actual and frankly I was expecting longer. We were seated at a small table on the other side of the divider from the counter which was OK.  Small but still was able to put my crutches in a place where they were out of the way and did not impede other diners.

Server was there shortly with menus and to take our beverage orders. My wife ordered just water and I went with  1/2 and 1/2 Sweeten Tea which was still too sweet. Hate to thing what regular sweet tea taste like.

We had looked over the menu on line before we came so we pretty much knew what we were going to order.

My wife order the Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich which is one of her favorites. Came with Fries but for $.50 more you had the option of upgrading up to Onion Rings which she did.

I ordered the Roast Tom Turkey over Dressing which came with a Salad and a Side. Tried to order a Baked Potato but that was not one of the listed sides so went with Potato Salad along with the Salad which I got with an Italian Dressing.

The Salad came out shortly along with Bread which was pretty good. The Salad was good also but unfortunately I had to look at the aftermath through out the rest of my meal as demonstrated by the attached photos.

After I was finished and when my main course was served, I asked if she would remove the dirty dishes and all I got was "" in a minute"".  Asked again another time but in the end, I ended up looking at these dishes throughout our stay.

Entrees in or themselves were good and portion were huge. My wife loved her Philly Cheese Steak and Onion Rings and because the portions were so large, ended up taking some home.

My Tom Turkey was also good and ended up taking some home as well. Problem was the Mustard Salad which was suppose to be Potato Salad. Could not taste anything beyond the mustard and my lips were still burning 30 minutes after I left the restaurant. 

Mustard is suppose to be a subtle addition to Potato Salad and suppose to accent the dish. It's another thing to overwhelm the dish to the point that that is all you can taste and 30 minutes later, your lips are still burning.

Final problem as on check out and I did not catch this but my wife did. The $.50 upgrade to Onion Rings had become $.75. Not a big thing but became a big thing for my wife after watching dirty dishes for 20 minutes while we ate lunch.

Parking is beyond their control. Seating is within their control and they did a good job. The service including the implicit refusal to remove dirty dishes, inaccurate billing and inedible side dishes are well  within the control of the restaurant.

Some good points at the restaurant and a number of less than desirable so let's just put it this way, I've experience better and in may cases, a lot better.",37,GGTF7hnQi6D5W77_qiKlqg

Stepping into the restaurant on a Wednesday night, we were pleasantly surprised to find that it wasn't overly crowded, especially at the bar where we had requested seats.

After our first cocktails (the refreshing and fruit filled Sake Sangria), we embarked on the tasting menu with the regular drink pairing. 

The first item sent to us was a Hamachi and miso amuse-bouche, in a Dashi tea. The small dish was delicate and sweet, the miso not at all overpowering. 

Next, the sashimi"" platter arrived, an elegant tile covered in wonderful confections, including a standout Chicken Sashimi. For those worried, the chicken is cured, not raw, and absolutely mouthwatering. Equally delicious, the Conch in stock practically defined the word ""Umami"". Less impressive, the Edamame mousse - which tasted bland and sticky - and the Shrimp jello, which consisted of an over-cooked shrimp in a cold gelatinous casing.

Our next course was presented with a flourish of smoke and drama - a ""Dashissoise"" playing both on the idea of classic French cold soup, and, well, Corned Beef. It was, for lack of a better description, effing yummy.

The fourth course consisted of a lovely ""vegetable garden"", complete with whimsical ""soil"" made out of fried Panko and olive crumbs. That 'Furikake' carried the dish. While winter melon is typically not the best Asian vegetable, the cubed and pickled gourd was crisp and fruity. A helping of fresh green peas certainly improved the vegetable course.

The middle of the meal was upon us, and so was one of the best things I have ever tasted. Chawanmushi, an ordinary egg pudding most Asian families are familiar with, was elevated to a height I had not expected, with the addition of Truffle oil and Grana Padano. It was comfort food turned into rich decadence, with the addition of two simple ingredients.

It was therefore disappointing when next, the Nanban course arrived with a lacklustre soue-vied salmon paired with a boring Harissa sauce. 

Disillusionment did not last for long. The next platter, a play on a very familiar meal of ham, beans and sausage, was covered in a buttery white sauce and cubes of fried Boudin Noir. Creamy blood sausage, pork fat...what's not to love? The cleverness of playing with such familiar ingredients - much like the Chawanmushi - contributed greatly to the enjoyment.

Dessert did provide one last lovely surprise; savoury flavours mixed with sweet (such a sure facet of Asian desserts) was a wonderful way to end the evening. Who knew edamame and chocolate would work so well together?

Aside from the food, the wine pairing throughout the meal was not exactly great. Ontario whites - reeking of bad grapes - did not deserve the foods they were paired with. The one Sake we were served told me that for ten dollars more, the Sake  pairing is probably the way to go in the future.

The clientele ranged from dignified Japanese men savouring every last item, to kids who didn't look up from their smartphones long enough to interact with each other, much less to enjoy the food set before them. 

Ultimately, the bad of this dining experience did not come close to outweighing the good. For the price and the quality, this restaurant is worth revisiting.",2,qyzaP2cbtouoAta3UbQRGg

I have been walking by here for weeks in anticipaction after I found out that it was going to be a ""Burger joint"" ressurected here. Burgers are one of my  true weaknesses and I am salivating just thinking about them.

Anyway, the place finally opens and I wander in all starry eyed with my Gf. The place seems pretty cool with a faux industrial decor and cool music playing in the background. The place is packed when we get there.

After studying the extensive menu I decided to go with the Smokey mountain burger with a side of poutine. My gf ordered the Teriyaki melt with a side of onion rings and of course we shared. We also added an egg on both burgers just cause we can. They have several other add-on options to maximize the gourmet burger feel.

My burger was really good! the poutine was also done to my liking. It wasn't the greatest burger I've tasted but I'd say in Toronto standards it would be one of my top 5. My gf's burger on the other hand was boring as hell. LOL . they mixed up our burgers at first and placed mine in front of her. She was laughing at mine becuase it looked so plain and unappetizing. Then I asked the waitress to clarify which burger was which and she apologized about the mix up. MY gf was so sad when she found out hers was the crappy one. LOL. The onion rings were ok I guess nothing too spectacular or different from any other onion rings I've tried and they were crispy. 

We ended up coming back here 3 times. Ordering the Smokey mountain burger with egg and poutine for a side. You cant go wrong with this order IMO. The last time we did go though my burger was undercooked, and my Gf's was overcooked. but 2 out of 3 isnt bad. I will keep you guys updated on our next visit.

Toronto needs decent burger places where you can sit and enjoy them.

Also many of the tricks are better viewed up close, I think, since they don't really have a video monitor for the whole show. So if you have the money, I'd recommend sitting closer (though you're at a greater risk of getting called on stage)! If you got discounted tickets like me, rest assured that sitting in the back or side is just fine. When we picked our seats at the box office, the diagram showed us at the very side, but when we got to the theater it didn't feel far out at all. I think any seat has a decent viewing angle.

It starts off with a envelope signing and box viewing experience, where you get to sign an envelope and view a box for two tricks during the show. The box trick was pretty good, though the envelope one was so-so. The rest of the tricks are done well, though they felt very short and discrete. It's a mixture of Penn and Teller doing something big, followed by Teller doing something simple. All in all a fun show to watch.

Transportation to the Rio isn't super convenient, since it's off the strip. You can get free shuttles from Bally's and/or Harrah's, but don't expect them to actually come every 30 min.

we had to wait a good 15-20 minutes before the first skewer came to our table, which was pork loin. i'm more of a beef guy and would normally pass, but i was hungry. it was very juicy depite getting one of the outer slices, but the crust made it even more enjoyable. this got my hopes up which were later shot down.
the other meats that came out were, roasted ham, sirloin, spicy chicken, pheasant, and bacon wrapped turkey. the ham tasted like it came from a store. the only thing i liked about the poultry is that they are not sliced so you know you get a fresh piece, as opposed to our ham and pineapple. (it seemed like we were always the last table to be served so we got all the pieces towards the center). the sirloin really let me down. i wasn't lucky enough to get the 1st slice, but by the 3rd slice the meat was a little too rare to my liking. the following rounds of sirloin all came to our table well done. the bacon wrapped turkey was good, but i would have loved to have some bacon wrapped filet. 
we've definitely had better, but we chose this place because we were hungry, but didn't want to go to one of the usual vegas buffets. if you choose to do the same, you can save a bunch by purchasing your meals via tix 4 tonight. they have a 50% off special for lunch at pampas.",2,a9ryl32-JJsYh-9lglOMFQ

I, however, found the one and only salon stylist who has no clue how to do a straight blow out.  She literally Did.  Not.  Know.  

Let me start by saying I've got Keratin treated hair and it's actually been within the past two months.  This means I need sulfate-free shampoo and I made sure to bring some of my own (with my own product too just in case) because really, what I wanted was just the blow dry which saves time and effort having someone else do it.  The KEratin makes it all super easy to just blow out.  But not if you got the girl I did.

While washing my ahri she wouldn't stop talking about how she wanted to get some hot rollers heating up for me.  I told her several times she shouldn't need to do anything like that.  All I wanted was the blow dry and maybe help pinning up a flower on one side of my head.

She began with my bangs and started to fluff them, blow dry against the cuticle, and rat with a brush.  I had to stop her and suggest she blow air in the opposite direction to keep it all smooth.  She warned me I wouldn't get any volume that way.  I explained again to her that I paid several hundred $ to get the volume and curl all out of my hair and that I wanted smooth and sleep and straight and that there was zero desire for volume.  She, with her 4inch-plus-ratted-hair-from-scalp-look, said she couldn't believe that because she could just make it look ""so purty"".

I normally wouldn't mock someone else's hair style so badly but when they work in the industry and refuse to listen to instructions on how to do the most simple of all salon styling procedures?  It's on.  

After offering her more tips (use the round brush to hold the hair and help heat the hair with the dryer blowing on the brush), she had got maybe 1/8 of hair dry when she turned off the blow dryer and announced she had to then go wash out another client's color.  

My hair was drying and frizzing (despite the Keratin!) right before my eyes since it wasn't getting proper heat drying!    I was near tears and had to go to the bathroom to calm myself down (reminded myself at least my friend the bride was getting the style she wanted and worst case was I had to wash and do my own hair all over).  

When I got my stylist's attention again I told her I was worried that she was letting my hair dry and frizz and reminded her that this took me abut 30 minutes to do, 20 mins if I went to salon (which I've done several times) and we were running past 45 minutes.  She told me she just wanted me to let her do it her way.  To me, this is absolutely unacceptable.  I pay to my hair done how I want it.  

My friend the bride finished her up do long before mine was even half dry and I knew I just needed to get out of the chair but not before the receptionist came over to inquire from my stylist how much to charge.  And then I got to listen in on my stylist whining that is was a very difficult case since I had treated hair (which should have made the blow dry talk half the time anyone else with the same amount of hair but that's only if one understands the concept of a blow straight).  I bit my tongue and didn't point out I had to bring all my own product and wasn't getting virtually any service whatsoever and just let her ramble on and decide to charge $35 for a butchery of a blow out.  

Final story?  This salon was a very terrible experience.  I'm appalled at the lacking experience and attitude from the stylist I had and disappointed in the lack of anyone intervening from the salon when it must have been obvious the stylist assigned to me was inadequately skilled to meet my needs.

They have an exclusive table for two on a second level that privately overlooks the restaurant. I definitely want to sit there next time! 

Since this was date night we ordered a bottle of wine from their extensive list. Our friendly waitress presented the wine for a sample for us to confirm and made sure to keep our glasses full during the meal. 

To start I ordered the garlic shrimp which came in a little bowl in a broth which was a surprise but delicious. The boyfriend ordered the clam chowder which was the best clam chowder I have had since San Francisco. I ordered the filet medallions medium, but they came out medium well but were still delicious. I also enjoyed the blue cheese mashed potatoes.

The star of the night was the braised curry lamb shank. I am not usually a fan of lamb but this dish was phenomenal. It was so tender it was falling off of the bone and the curry sauce was light and fragrant. I don't believe I have ever had a steak in front of me and ever envied anyone else's dish - especially not a lamb dish! Unfortunately this wonder is not on the regular menu.

When we ordered, we said we were sharing everything and asked for plates for the splitting.  No problem at all.

We started with an amuse-bouche of chick peas on lightly toasted bread.  A very nice starter to get the meal off to a tasty start.

First up were two starters--warm tripe ""alla""Romana and country style paté.  Both were excellent.  The tripe was cut in small strips that were very tender and the tomato sauce was mild and complimented the tripe perfectly. There was freshly grated cheese on top.   The paté, made with pork, was served with blackberry conserve, greens, and cotica.  The paté was very good.  Two nice starters to begin the meal.

For the pasta course, we got the pork trotter ravioli and the beef cheek ravioli.  They allowed us to order off the tasting menu for the beef cheek ravioli.  For the pork trotter, there was freshly grated cheese.  The beef cheek ravioli was in a sauce of black truffles and crushed duck liver.  Both dishes were superb!  The beef cheek had a hearty flavor of truffle and liver.  The pork trotter had pieces of chive and their blossoms.  The textures in the pork trotter ravioli were great.  Two winners for the pasta course.

For main courses, we got rabbit porchetta and roasted lamb shoulder.  The rabbit was accompanied by a carrot sformato, sunflower sprouts and crispy confit.  The flavors were excellent and the rabbit was very tasty.  The lamb shoulder was cooked medium rare and served with cannellini beans and some greens.  Both main courses wer outstanding!  Very flavorful, simple yet elegant dishes.  

For dessert, M ordered the chocolate budino and I ordered a special--peaches and cream.  M's budino was made more like a soufflé and the chocolate could have been richer.  The top was pierced and some melted chocolate poured on the top.  The peaches and cream were fantastic!  The dish consisted of lightly grilled peach slices on a bed of mascarpone and a peach sorbet.  A very simple dish executed so nicely.

After dinner, we were brought a box with 7 mignardises.  A tasty selection of little bites to end our meal.  

Service was outstanding during our meal.  Plates were cleared quickly, new silverware and dishes were brought for each course, and the explanations of the dishes was great!

After walking by B&B so many times and looking at the menu, it was really good to try the place.  Eating with a friend also gave me the chance to taste double the amount of items without eating double the amount of food.",12,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

Pricey, I know. I went straight for the crab legs, just like everybody else. I piled on about 5-6 sections and tried to chow down. They must have a gotten a great deal on these crab legs because I was barely able to get anything out of them. When I did get some crab meat it was falling apart and stringy. It's a shame these crabs gave their lives to have most of their meat thrown away. I moved onto the muscles and clams, thinking they had to be better. Now, I know all of these things come from the sea, but they were the fishiest tasting specimens I've ever had. Again, a waste of a living organism. Finally, I gave the fruit a shot. That was the only thing I ate all of. My advice is to go to the oyster bar and pay $32 for the 1.5 pounds of crab legs where you can actually get some quality meat out of them.",1,6RVRH9sXqwEgcCkakyWmrw

I decided to join the crowd and wait to write the review until I tried Mineo's.  This was an interesting tactic, as I usually write reviews pretty quickly and just save them as drafts if I don't want to post them immediately.  So this is what was special about Aiello's:

I don't really remember.

The pizza wasn't great and the pizza wasn't bad.  The crust was a medium thickness with a sweeter sauce and not as much cheese as I like.  I remember thinking that around $20 for a large cheese pizza seemed like too much.  As I was moving the day I got the pizza, delivery would have been really nice.  The storefront was standard pizza store.  But, kids, that's it.

Would I come back here?  Probably.  I might try the specialty pizzas or just order some different kinds by the slice.  But I just didn't think Aiello's was anything to write home about.

She said she'd give me a call once they had it and that either way they'd call me if they didn't have it so I can go to another store. She took my information down on Tuesday, it's now Saturday and I haven't heard from anyone. Really would like to not live off the samples forever and need to know if I should go to another store to get this foundation. What gives?
----
I gotta say I've been pretty disappointed by the level of customer service this location has and have agreed with one of the other reviews about not once being greeted. Normally I don't like being bothered when I'm shopping but when you're spending the money on high quality products, and there are so many here, you definitely want to make sure your getting the right one and being able to ask their expertise and even get acknowledged when you are in the store goes a long way.
I've been to this location 4 times and 3 out of the 4 times I spent about 20-30min walking around and not one person acknowledged me or asked if I needed help. I wasn't sure if I just didn't look the part for them to care about me enough as a customer, either way it wasn't a good feeling and unsure about what to get I left all 3 times without a purchase. 
I decided to give this location another shot, it's the most convenient and I was in desperate need of more foundation. Down to the last drop I wanted to try a different foundation that had great reviews but I needed to be matched. Walking in from the parking lot I was literally thinking how much time it would take until someone noticed me.
Things weren't looking good but I think people should keep in mind to that this is a small location, most Sephora's have handfuls of employees always moving around the store and a dedicated greeter at the front. This location probably only has about 2-3 employees that I've seen at any given time. 
About 5min in Emma saved the day and swooped by to ask me if I needed help. I let her know I wanted to get color matched, let her know my skin concerns and we were off to the races. During my mini consult I remembered what I liked about Sephora compared to most other beauty stores like Ulta. I feel like when you can get an employee then they are devoted to you during that time, they aren't running off to multitask other customers, they don't rush you in and out, they really hone in on what you want and need and want to make you look good. 
Emma did a fantastic job of nailing the color I needed for my skin, we shared beauty and cleansing routines. I just really felt like I could take my time and hers and she had no problem showing me how to use products. I ended up spending about $50 more than I thought I would on other products because I felt like I had that initial direction from her and then I could go through and try other things with confidence. I left the store feeling super happy with my purchases and excited to implement them into my daily routine. While they were out of the foundation I wanted she gave me a nice amount of the product as a sample to hold me over until they got some in. 
Kudos to Emma, I hope when I return that she is there to help, I felt like she really went above and beyond to help me out and having that 1 on 1 time with the employees at Sephora makes you feel special, and it's why I've been moving away from Ulta and willing to come here more and more for my makeup needs.",1,wYTMFvw3_UetcniRKxtUzg

I went to Gene's shop with my car and he did incorrect work which did led unnecessary work, charged me more than the dealer would have, tried to milk 850 $ for a new computer (ECU), and pushed me into taking the car to the dealer to have it fixed. 

The dealer fixed it by fixing the wiring that Gene did wrong to begin with.


================= The whole story ======================

The story started when I got Crankshaft and Camshaft sensor error codes on my Nissan Altima 2005.

I bought the parts from Autozone and replaced them myself. It turned out that after spending 5 hours working on getting to a hard to reach sensor, it didn't fix the problem so I decided to take the car to Gene to have it fixed.

He proceeded re-wiring a connector that would no longer clip in after  I undid the crankshaft sensor.

That didn't fix it. He told me the sensors I got from Autozone were no good based on research he did online in auto forums and that I needed OEM sensors. I let him do the job. He replaced the sensors with the dealer sensors and the problem didn't go away.

Next he checked all the wiring for which he charged me 120$ diagnosis fee (dealer charges 90$). 

He told me it all checked out fine and that I needed to replace the computer (ECU) for something like 850 dollars.

So I took the car to the dealer to have the computer reprogrammed because usually computers don't just break to the point of no way to repair them. He did encourage me to have the dealer replace the computer so I give him that. 

Reprogramming the computer didn't fix the problem so I gave the dealer another 90 for diagnosis of the problem.

The dealer fixed the problem immediately after for 40 dollars! It was the wiring that was bad which Gene redid, and diagnosed for 200$.

Total rip-off Gene. Stay away. If you can't do the job yourself, take it to your dealer.

lesson learned for 370$ fee from Gene, 210$ from the dealer, 70$ in parts from Autozone, 5 hours of time wasted, frustration, and inconvenience of having to ask friends for rides for 5 days. 

Ultimately I took the car back to Gene after the dealer fixed it so that he can see what the dealer did. He refunded me 203$ which included diagnosis and CKP sensor replacement sensor. I'm still down 360$ though for the other stuff he did and the money I had to give to the dealer to diagnose, do what Gene did again and re-program the ECU which Gene said was bad.

He also said that I didn't deserve part of the refund because I was the one who broke the connector I had him fix in the first place.

The good part is that I got to hang out with my friend who helped me fix it for the 5 hours.",14,w51xb8Sajlz3f7hbc95HnA

We ordered a few different meals (e.g., souvlaki, salmon, hamburgers, salad, etc.). The food was tasty and definitely worth the price! They also included dinner rolls which was a nice surprise. The hamburger patty was a little thinner than I expected but what it lacked in size it made up for in taste. They also got all of our customizations right so that was greatly appreciated. 

The fries were delivered in a box with no holes/vents so the fries were a bit soggy when we received them; however, the fries still tasted good so that was a welcome surprise. The souvlaki and salmon were also tasty, while the vegetables were just okay imo. The onion rings were out of this world good! I wish I had bought one for myself rather than splitting it amongst my family (at least now I know for next time). 

The Greek salad was also good (although as a cheese lover I would have preferred more feta on the salad).

The area was not very busy at the time, with very few customers seated and no one waiting up front. 

It took a few minutes for someone to realize we were waiting to be seated, but from that point forward service was on point. 

We decided to share 2 apps (crispy potatoes as well as the chips with guac) and a wild mushroom pizza. The crispy potatoes were served with a delicious red chimichurri sauce, the chips with guac were tasty but the serving size was woefully small for the price (even on the strip). The pizza was delicious, get the white truffle oil to drizzle on top. 

We had limited time to eat, and while we never expressed this to our server, we were able to get in and out in a rather short amount of time, which meant we did not miss any of the event we were attending.

I was born in Phoenix but have lived in Texas.  While in Texas I was told a couple of tips on finding a great bbq place.  First, if you can't smell bbq when you are in the parking lot, leave asap.  I couldn't smell bbq even when I was walking in the front door, but I still decided to give Pork On A Fork a try.  The second tip I was told was that a great bbq place always has sweet tea or at least decent ice tea, here I found an ""Out of Order"" sign taped over the ice tea machine!  Yup, a machine!  

Still I said I would try this place and I did.  I got the pulled pork sandwich, and sides of bbq beans and  potato salad.  The beans were decent but I would suggest adding some brown sugar to them.  (Hey, my grandmother did that with her bbq beans and they rocked!)  The potato salad was boring and bland.  It didn't help that about half of the potatoes that were cut into small cubes were under cooked.  The pulled pork was a lukewarm mixture, either dry or VERY chewy.  The last piece I had tasted off and left a horrible taste in my mouth,  Also, I picked up a squeeze bottle from another table for some sauce only to find out the entire bottle had sauce all over the outside of it.

I ate in the dining area down the hall from where you order and it has ZERO bbq joint ambiance.  Music was playing but it was Bill Haley and the Comets followed by other 1950's rock and roll songs.  (BBQ joint or Johnny Rockets?)

There were three employees in the place and two of them passed my table several times but said nothing.  There were only four other customers in the place and they were together in a booth across the room.  When I left no one said anything to me.  (""How was it?  Thank you!  Do we suck?"", etc.)

When Graham and I were going to bed Friday night it dawned on me that we had no plans for Saturday morning, so I decided that we needed to have brunch. I hopped on Open Table and made a reservation. The restaurant is over on a side of town that was always pretty shady when I was a kid. So it's very cool to see it being revitalized and filling up with excellent, local places.

Graham and I started with cocktails. I had a $3 mimosa and he had a bloody mary. Their bloody mary bar is pretty awesome. You pick the vodka, and choose from a variety of mixers and add-ins. I had never had a bloody mary before, so I had a sip of his. I took one sip and promptly realized I don't care for them and would be sticking with mimosas.

Graham had a breakfast that was, in his words, ""a vegans nightmare"". This was two eggs, a potato cake, and steaks with carmelized onions and bernaise sauce. This breakfast made me wish I liked runny eggs, because this looked so, so good. I did try the steak though, and it (and the sauce) was so delicious.

His breakfast had nothing on my french toast. This was a huge piece of brioche, fresh fruit, syrup and orange zest. This was sweet, delicious and filling. I typically don't like syrup on my french toast, but with the fruit and the hint of orange flavor, it really worked. I would order this again and again. I did order a side of bacon (un-pictured), which was just okay. It was thick, but wasn't crispy at all.

The server was a little slack (it took way to long for her to return with drinks and to take our orders, since there were only 2 other tables in the entire restaurant, but whatever. She was friendly and our food was delicious.",3,HT7T6OaKuJHU35j9u0LUDA

Located on the corner of Bonneville at the Juhl, le Pho is an amazing little spot with fresh quality yummy Pho.

Close to our house we come here quite often. 

We always order either jasmine or pomegranate rooibos hot tea. 

Our app is always the vegan roll a soft hand roll filled with shiitake, radish, asparagus and other yummy veggies, including Thai basil. They come with a large dish of hoisin/peanut sauce. 

My better half always orders vegan Pho. Amazing broth full of flavor and A TON of noodles. Exactly how we love it. It has red onion, scallion, fresh zucchini, and sprouts on the side.
I always take all the Thai basil, lime slices and fresh jalapeño off the side topping plate. :D Hubs likes it without.

So much so that while the Eastern location which is closest to me is closed down in preparation of a new location opening soon, I drove all the way to this location instead of just settling for the Chipotle down the street.   That's partially not true as I was somewhat in the area before deciding to get some take-out for lunch, but it was definitely much less convenient than going the Chipotle route and dammit I still took it.

This location seemed much nicer aesthetically than any other Zaba's I've been to.   That's not to say that they usually aren't nice because they are, but something about this one just seemed a step ahead.   It was packed for lunch but the employees were on top of their game in within a few minutes I was out the door with a couple Zaba Bowls to go.   

I did my usual, a zaba bowl with brown rice, shredded beef, corn, green salsa, and lettuce.   It's about as healthy a meal I can put together at any of these fresh-mex joints that I can still enjoy.   I found it to be a good version of the same thing I've gotten 100 times at the Eastern location.   The shredded beef was nicely spiced (I've had it on occasion lack spiciness which I believe is due to it not being stewed long enough to soak it all in) and the veggies were fresh and as tasty as veggies can be.   My rice was a little mushier than I normally like it, so that was my only minor gripe.   I also shared a bag of chips and they were spot on as usual.   

A good value became even better recently with the introduction of the Zaba's reward card with which every 10 entrees purchased you get the 11th free.   Points are doubled on Sundays.   Since I go to the other location at least 2-3 times a week and buy for 2, I average a free entree every 2-3 weeks.   WHAT HAS CHIPOTLE DONE FOR ME LATELY?   Exactly.",1,v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g

I've now bumped up the rating from a 1 to a 4 for my overall experience.  Lauren L., Customer Advocate Manager, was great.  She promptly followed up with me to discuss my issues I was experiencing.  She was very friendly and genuinely sounded like she was concerned.  Also, my Loan Officer, Erik E, reached out to me to make sure everything was processed timely and followed through to closing.  Everything finally closed a few days late but none the less, closed and finalized.

I originally selected  RoundPoint based on feeling the most comfortable with my Loan Officer after a few initials contacts through phone and email.  They weren't the lowest rates but one of the lowest plus very responsive.  One thing I would say is be aware of and double check all the numbers.  After I decided to go with RoundPoint, they changed the initial offer by charging more fees.  Again, I choose to go with them because I was most comfortable with them but this definitely made be pay closer attention to the rest of the paperwork.  There were a few things here and there (could have been computer or human error) that I caught but RoundPoint corrected those along the way.  I guess this can happen with any bank, so I would recommend to check everything!

I was on the fence about the updated rating but overall gave the 4 based on RoundPoint resolving my issues and promptly taking action.  I feel the added stress and aggravation would have been nice to avoid in the first place but what's important is it was addressed and everything is done now.",2,7ARhTi9zkuOpzMWqv6oSAw

From my perspective, the place is nicely decorated, clean and has a nice vibe to it. Tables are pretty close together but the emptiness allows you a lot of privacy. Not a bad place for a date :)

Everything has tasted so great each time we order it and for the fact that each dish is either $1, $5, or $7, it is a lot of food.

Here we go, HEAD TO HEAD COMPARISON:  Stayed at Encore one-year ago--slightly more stunning (bigger/more stylish rooms in comparison to ""Wynn"").  This is uber-luxury as all the reviews will signal to you.  A couple reviews below, a gentlemen suggested that he would stay ""someplace nicer"" next time to LV.  Sir, I would like to fight you--such a place does not exist!

Wynn (and Encore also) is impeccably clean, doesn't cater to children, and will cost you at each turn.  Room service/ minibar prices are out of sight.  We always eat a meal or two on the property and explore the Strip and Vegas for the rest (only so many meals you can schill before the receipts in your wallet start to haunt you).

The Wynn resort rooms were recently renovated in Fall, 2010, including updates on colorings of hallways, bedding, artwork, curtains in the room, and furniture upgrades. Spa (per the Wife) is lovely and service was top notch on a custom massage.  Nice ""private"" entry via the room elevators (Though she informs me that the spa at Encore feels more ""secluded"" vis-a-vis the Salon and people coming and going).

No real problem of note: the ludicrous $129 in minibar charges (ONLY 8 items!!) appeared on my television guest bill folio.  These were quickly removed with a single call to the front desk (and a single inquiry to me [""Sir is it possible that someone put anything/ moving anything in fridge?""  Me: ""No ma'am, we only dared examine the $12 bag of potato chips; we didn't even open the fridge during our stay!""].  This too is illustrative of the attitude you'll find--you're the boss, you just have to pay SW's price (which BTW, slow season rates continue to bewilder--midweek under $150 per night= absolute bargain).

Restaurants are top notch at both properties.  But ""Wynn's Casino""  has the advantage, IMO, on size, feel, traffic, and most of all--the only poker room between the properties is housed at Wynn's casino space.

SW- I admire you. You are a business hero; your personal style is iconic and I love to visit your world.  I confess that I actually watch your Wynn promo [NOTE: yes, i said ""PROMO""] programming more than I watch television channels during the few moments of down time.",4,6pJICQMKi7CjMIKU-y9oTQ

We were very lucky to get a reservation at the last minute, the hostess was very sweet and accommodating! The space itself is small, tastefully decorated, and feels like a step outside of Vegas entirely- it's quietly luxurious, with intimate tables and dimmed lighting. The minute we sat down, our waiter came over and explained the specials, one of which we decided to order, the Sukiyaki. We started with the Raku Tofu, which you would have to be crazy not to try. It is unlike anything I have ever experienced. The wait staff explain how best to enjoy it (first with some Green Tea salt, then with some ginger, green onion, and bonito flakes with a bit of soy sauce), and it is unbelievably delicious and silky. Even if you don't usually like tofu, I highly recommend trying this! We also tried the agedashi tofu, which was equally delicious and served in a perfectly seasoned broth with nori flakes and salmon roe, and a little spot of chili sauce on the side of the bowl to be used sparingly. Next we tried the kobe beef with garlic, which was another huge hit- incredibly flavorful, tender, just perfect. I am no steak expert, but my boyfriend is, and he was just as blown away as I was. We had the crispy deep fried chicken, which was served on top of a bed of spinach dressed with what I think was a soy vinaigrette- amazing. Then came the duck in a balsamic soy glaze, which is another MUST-order here- again, completely unlike anything I've ever tasted. We shared one stuffed small portobello, which was outstanding, and then came the sukiyaki. If they have this special when you visit, I cannot recommend it highly enough. It comes with eggs, which you crack into your own bowl and then use as a dipping sauce- I didn't do that part, but the sukiyaki itself was just unreal. The broth was perfect, not too salty but by no means bland, and there were noodles, tofu, greens, japanese eggplant, and the most amazing, thin sliced beef either of us had ever tasted. We made the mistake of ordering one too many things, and by the time the grilled rice balls (aka onigiri but without the nori) arrived, we were both right on the verge of being too full. If you are a fan of really high quality rice, you will love these- one is brown rice and flavored with bonito flakes, and one is white rice with a shinto leaf wrapped around it. Both are of course fantastic, but for us they weren't the stars of the evening the way the tofu and beef had been. And of course it wasn't over, we ordered the fluffy cheesecake- both of us gasped when we tried it. It is like eating a cheesecake cloud. It is the lightest, fluffiest cheesecake that exists on earth, I am sure of it. Even if you decide to follow up your meal with a trip to Sweets Raku (it was closed when we went, otherwise we probably would have gone- next time for sure!), this is another must. On top of the beyond amazing food, they have a fantastic wine and sake list, and the service was truly exceptional. Warm, attentive, prompt, helpful- it felt like we were being spoiled! I seriously can't recommend Raku highly enough. We will be coming back ALL THE TIME!",0,1feVtiImRteyeNNZVh2f3Q

The movie watching experience here just lacks something, but it makes up for it by having all their cinemas in digital quality, I enjoy the popcorn here (but lack of shakers is a downer for me), I wish they had a bit more range when it comes to the concession stand, it IS in the heart of the city. 

The system is a little unusual with the box office located 3 stories below the theatre, with automated machines at both locations. And as someone that comes here around twice a week, I am more familiar with their loyalty program than most people that work the box office, which is a little frustrating having to explain their own system to them, but the staff at the customer desk are always very friendly.

The midnight release experience here is clearly inferior to that at Scotiabank as they cannot accommodate large lines inside, and had people lining up in the food court for the Harry Potter release, it was the same for tiff, rush lines would be in the food courts and it gets confusing very fast. 

The IMAX experience at first glance seems less impressive than what I'm used to, but after a few trips to both this and the Scotia one, I'm coming to realise the disparity is not as large. 

Their ETX seems larger than the Scotiabank Ultra experience, but the lack of seat assignments makes this lose out on that front. 

If you watch a movie (even if it's once a month or so) it makes so much sense to sign up for their loyalty program which trumps the scene due to the reduced ticket prices, although the rewards come in smaller portions than Scene's, but AMC provides free popcorn via emailed coupons every Monday - Thursday if you pay attention to their emails. 

But this is a massive complex, their movie options are questionable at times (having 3 Indian movies playing in the same time period for e.g.) but it does deliver on the quality front which is enough for me.",5,9W73B44Iw8WslrTNB2CdCg

However, Flip Dunk didn't share my disappointment. After waiting on hold for 10 minutes, the representative informed me that I would be able to receive passes to attend another day. So, I pulled it together and took all the kids to the movies to celebrate and informed all of the parents we would be returning to FD at a later date to jump.

I repeat, THEATER 13. We used our phone flash lights because strangely, the theater was pitch black. And I'm glad we did because to our horror, the seats were stained with all kinds of goop & gunk. All sorts of colors too. Oh my gawdddd. My bf who cannot control his filter whatsoever even commented loudly, ""wow...these seats are disgusting. Did they show a porno in here?"" Theater 13 must not been cleaned since the 90s. Yuck. Get your shit together, AMC. Such a shame there's only two locations in this city too...so it was slim pickings for us. Oh man.

Some familiar, some different then previous Japanese menus I have seen. I had the spicy salmon roll, it wasn't ""fishy"" tasting at all, which, although it is fish, is a good thing in my book. I also had a basic cucumber/avacado roll. The lunch special comes with a choice of soup or salad. I enjoyed my food immensely.

Elegantly decorated in rich, dark colours, low lighting, upscale furniture and an intimate ambiance, this place is great to bring a date to.  

The menu is contemporary Italian, with it's decent selection of anitpasti's, pastas and mains.  If I ever see beef carpaccio on the menu I have to get it as a base of comparison.  For mains we got the pappardelle with wild boar ragu, and the butternut squash and veal stuffed ravioli(?) with pistachios and truffle oil.  

Carpaccio was beautifully pink, super vibrant colouring, with a fresh taste to boot.  Pastas were good not great, nothing to really complain about, but nothing to rave about either.  I'd say the stuffed Veal pasta was better than my pappardelle as it had more depth of flavours and textures.  The pistachios were a fun inclusion.

For dessert we split the apple strudel with pear compote and vanilla ice cream.  The pastry itself wasn't hot enough and thus not flaky enough to  cut up with my fork - it felt like I had to fight with it in order to break off a piece.  Meanwhile the ice cream was still very frozen and rock solid. 

The service was very friendly and polite albeit a little smothering.  Our waiter would come by every 3 minutes to ask us something and thank us profusely when we accepted his offer to refill our water glasses.

$100 for two, an app, a cocktail, two mains, cappacino and dessert.  Pretty reasonable.  To be fair, I would like to give Carisma 3.5 stars, as it was a pleasant dining experience. I just can't see myself wanting to go back.",5,6b4yYexmPQglmNdNum531Q

On the ride up we saw Hyde as the train made it's stop at the New Bern platform - and they might as well made the stop in the brewery!  After eating and walking around we got on the train and our son told us to goto the brewery (I swear!), so we jumped off at New Bern and rolled into the place like we owned it.

You enter through double glass doors into a covered outdoor area with long wood tables with planters in the middle of them.  Enter another set of double doors into the main bar area - filled with booths, high tops, and a long bar that wraps around to a coffee/espresso area.  Why you would ever go to a brewery and get coffee I don't know - but I guess the train station being there makes it convenient to people - but no one should rate this place based on a coffee experience!  

Our bartender was excellent - when we asked about getting a flight - he informed us of the $3 any Charlotte beer special - and basically sold us on getting 2 points each versus 2 flights for a little cheaper.  He knew the beer on tap, and started handing us samples before we could ask.  We selected our first beer and started to head to the covered patio area.  Upon seeing an outdoor picnic table area - we ran out there with the 2 girls that were enjoying the weather with their puppy.  

Our kid ran around playing with the gravel rocks that was laid over the area and watched the construction, trains and people.  We grabbed 2 more beers each after that and some french fries.

The Beer was tasty - not the best I've ever had, but much better than some other places.  The fries were good, albeit a small portion.  The weather was perfect, the bartender was awesome, and the girls at the other table were good eye candy for my wife to yell at me for looking at!  It was an excellent visit and we want to go back!

I was thinking of getting the billionaire burger since foie gras is now illegal in Cali, but couldn't bring myself to fork out $30 for a burger.

I was going to go with the nom nom burger, but my waiter sold me on the Gold Standard which he said was voted the best burger in Las Vegas.  How could I not try it now?  It came out pretty fast.  It did not look messy and presentation was done well.

The burger itself was above average and I give it a solid 4 stars.  However, I disagree that it is the best burger in Las Vegas and definitely disagree with the $17 price tag.  So if you're curious, to try, you will be getting a good tasting high quality burger, but you're going to pay for it.  I liked it, but I think it's a one and done for me.

The Gold Standard: 4/5

I get slot comps often for food at the Palms, and this usually means grabbing something at the Food Court on my way out the door. The last time I did this will be last for the following reasons. 

1. The McDonalds at the Palms makes you pay for any amount above your comp with cash only. No Credit or Debit cards no matter how much the difference is. This sucks if you have just lost all your cash in a machine and are hungry. I am not going to an ATM and pay a $5 fee to get more cash so I can use a $10 comp. 

2. After dealing with the above I finally placed an order for less than $10 bucks to use my comp only to see a big cockroach running across the counter as I was getting my drink. The manager in charge at the time seemed shocked that I no longer wanted to eat my food. She acted like cockroaches crawling about was just a normal part of her day. 

3. If one establishment in the food court has such a problem with cockroaches then how many others in this part of the hotel do? Is this a problem with the entire hotel? Either way I am not going to use my food comps any more this will more than likely mean I will spend less money playing slots at the palms.

So it's around 4am (and NO I was not drunk!) There were five of the six girls that stuck with me after Haze. Some wanted chinatown, some wanted steak & eggs.. We ended up here because our heels were killing us, haha.

Anyway! It took us a while to find the entrance, but since we went up the escalators after Haze we saw people that were sitting in the café. We walked through the back & the servers quickly told us that we went the wrong way. They directed us to the host stand, where the hostess was PRETENDiNG to be busy & clean menus. We apologized to her & tried joking around but she never lifted her head or looked at us until somebody else sat us, which was a good 3-4 minutes. Believe me people, I have been a hostess for a solid two years at a fine dining restaurant that offers late night menu on the weekends until 2am & I've had my share of working with those RUDE hostesses that are purposely give attitude or can't do your job & greet your guests. I believe that you should try to act as professional as you can, no matter how late it is or how crappy your day/night is (sorry mini rant! lol). Other than the stupid hostess, our server was perfectly fine.

The café is very modern & spacious. The utensils were awesome, I wanted to take them home & blow bubbles with them! The round table we had was against the wall in the left side of the restaurant. Some of the tables in the middle of the café were set higher & it almost reminded me of a fancy library :P It could be a bad thing, but I thought just about everything in the restaurant looked neat. 

Three of the girls ordered omelets, eggs benedict, philly cheesesteak (looked tasty btw) & I ordered the oriental chicken salad. The salad was a good amount for $15, I ended up taking it home because it was too much for me at 4am haha. The bill for five people was $86, so I would say most of the items in the menu are $13-20. It was what I was expecting because it is on the strip & we couldn't decide on where to eat anyway :) I'll probably be back again late at night to try out that cheesesteak! yum yum",1,VomrqwTbz1hxmZpL69u5XQ

The first time I went was the day after they opened and I was very impressed by how clean and organized the shop was. I purchased a few of the self serve bulk candy that u scoop yourself, weigh, and then pay. A couple weeks later I returned with my son and he chose similar candy and a similar amount. This time the total cost was 3 times more than the amount I had paid the first time I came. I questioned the cashier right away and she just shrugged and didn't care that there was such a huge discrepancy. No customer service skills whatsoever. 

I returned a third time today and the shop was much more crowded and dirty. Some of the scoopers were broken and the candy appeared unfresh. I wanted to leave right away but my son insisted I buy him some bulk candy. So once again I scooped his candy and it was weighed and I paid a similar amount to the FIRST time I came! So I know the second time I came I was definitely overcharged by over $15! 

I'm not impressed by this place at all. The cashier today didn't say hi, didn't ask if I found everything I was looking for, as a matter of fact she didn't say one word to me, and she didn't even give me a bag to carry the candy out.

I was quickly greeted by the bartender, who was very nice despite me being there on the dot of opening. 

He asked me how I had heard of Wren House, and I explained that I had seen their beers around the area at places such as Sip and The Pig's Meow. 

I love clean, fresh IPAs. Their wren house IPA is fantastic. They reminds me of the Green Flash beers - strong and intense. I purchased two beers to drink there and a baby growler to go for $20.00. Not bad! 

They do not have food at this time but I was informed that something is in the works for bringing in a food company / small bites. I think an olive/nuts/cheese board would be the perfect accompaniment to their beers. Never fear though, they've got chips and pork rinds! 

A great addition to the bar is the Trivial Pursuit placed on the tables. I highly recommend this for a family with 20-somethings and older folks as this place appeases all generations!",6,sHY6JcgWOHLP4vR836Esmw

Unsafe lock. You name it they have it.

It was the only room in town. I got in at 11 And ran out at 3am. Lost money but my life was in danger. It's that bad. I stayed in ""cheap"" hotel before but that one gets a five stars for craziness. The owner is so used to this madness that it's the norm for him.

Your room literally shakes every time someone goes up the stairs. Screaming at all time in the hall, shower curtain was used in place of window curtains, the shower was gross. The electrical panel in the bathroom had been painted over! The trash can is a grease bucket. You hear all the sounds coming from the room next yours and the room above you.

I like a one stop shop, and Butcher's Market gives you just that, in local products. They have everything from beautiful cuts of meat to craft beer, to veggies and pimento cheese. Everything is always fresh and you can tell that they've put thought into their selections. The cuts are the best of the best, but they're happy to tell you what are second and third best - if you're looking for something more in that price range. You can find cheese in the back - I'm back on a pimento cheese kick, and they have Pasta & Provisions products in the freezer! I stop in here on Saturdays for the Farmers' Market outside, and then stop inside and pick up my meats (and samples!). They have a very large selection of craft beer for a store of this size, and you'll often find not only food samples, but beer samples as well! I love seeing the hyper local regulars - Bird Song, OMB, Unknown, along with some state wide NC breweries. 

The staff is super helpful and friendly, they'll assist in answering any questions and even tell you how to cook/marinate/smoke/prepare the foods that they sell should you need any guidance (I usually do.). They're always grilling something outside on Saturdays, and this has a very strong potential to change your meal plans. I've come in here a handful of times sure that I was looking for marinated chicken, and walked out with steak instead. haha - who's surprised? No one. 

They are a higher priced butcher, but I feel like it is definitely worth it for one-on-one assistance from staff and the quality of meats and foods that you can purchase here. If you want big box store kind of help, go to a big box store. If you want a little more attention to detail and a larger local selection, go to Butcher's Market.",7,QLgFEumhrHq6LgbEOKCzdw

Basically, this place has two menus - a regular menu and a specials menu.  The regular menu is very brief, and basically consists of - eggs+bacon, eggs+corned beef, and a few croissant sandwiches.  I tried the eggs and corned beef, which tasted decent, but it was nothing to brag about.

The specials menu changes every day and has more unique creations such as open faced omelets, eggs benedicts, fish tacos and a different play on grilled cheese each day.  I tried the fish tacos and thought there was too much cabbage and it was a little bland.  However, I think if eggs benedict had been on the menu when I went, I might have developed a different opinion altogether...

I've been meaning to try this place since it's very close to my work and I love Japanese and Thai food so I couldn't wait to try. It's nicely decorated with modern touch. So it was a good start! Can't complain anything about the atmosphere and ambiance. I took my gf during lunch and there were only 2 tables occupied, so they weren't busy at all. That should've been my first hint not to order anything raw but I was craving sushi. My gf ordered the salmon terriyaki bento and I got the sushi bento. My gf frowned as soon as she took the first bite. The salmon had to be frozen since it was so chewy and had that ""old"" fish smell to it. Onto my food...my 5 nigris weren't bad at first except the rice were undercooked. We also had their crepe cake desert since it looked so appertizing but the taste wasn't impressive at all. I bought the groupon and wanted to use it but the waitress said we can't use groupon for any lunch special. Little disappointed but no big deal. I'll come back and use it for something later, I thought. 
I started to feel nauseated that night and sure enough, had to make many trips to the toilet! X( Luckily I got over it without much more problems other than feeling lethargic for couple days. 
I really like their concept of modernizing Japanese/Thai fusion food but the execution isn't just there! The service was nice and the waitress seemed to be the owner, who wanted to fullfill the American Dream. I do wish the best and wish they can improve and fix things quickly!

And it's a birthday, not like we are just bringing our own dessert for the heck of it.  We decided not to do it.

We order probably $200 worth of food and drinks and asked if we could have 3 rolls to come with our dinner.  No big deal right?  WRONG!  Our server came back and says they have 5 left for someone that may come in for a sandwich and will not accommodate us with any rolls and did not offer for us to purchase a couple.

For some reason, the wife and our friend were under the impression that the show would be sensual and burlesque like Crazy Horse Paris at the MGM. Well, as many reviewers have mentioned, its not....I am sure the wife would give me crap for a 3 star review (I think she'd probably go with a .5)...but the show completely met my expectations. It was cheesy, high energy and full of boobs. As just about every other review states, Holly Madison really can't dance, and she doesn't do much at all. The show is really all a huge build up to the very short ""dance"" number that Holly does topless at the end of the show. There were numbers in the show that were more entertaining than others (i.e. Pink), but most every dance was the same thing with different props. The singers weren't bad, though the male singer was a bit unconvincing.

My wife was not received by a doctor, but by Sonia the Nurse Practitioner and she diagnosed my son with having an ear infection. 

Sonia asked my wife which pharmacy she preferred, my wife told her the Walgreens on Alma School and Guadalupe.  Before leaving, my wife asked for the prescription and the nurse said that they would call and order it in and to not worry about it, that they would get it taken care of.  

Around 4:45pm that same day, my wife didn't hear anything from Walgreens so she called the pharmacy and they said that nothing had been ordered yet.  My wife, knowing that Healing Hearts would close quickly, called them and they said that it had been ordered at the Walgreens on Dobson and Warner.  My wife told them No and that it needed to be ordered at Alma School and Walgreens.  

Later that evening, we went to Walgreens and we were told that they didn't have any record that the prescription had been ordered.  Worried, we went to the other Walgreens on Dobson and Warner and they said the same thing.  Thinking there may have been a mistake in the pharmacy company, we even went to CVS but none of their locations showed anything was ordered.  After driving around for an hour and a half, I began to realize that Healing Hearts never ordered the prescription.  HEALING HEARTS NOT ONLY DIDN'T ORDER THE PERSCRIPTION, THEY LIED ABOUT ORDERING IT. 

To put it simply--my son had a nasty fever all night, the vomitings continued, and he slept that night roughly an hour.    

The following morning, 4/14/2016, I called Healing Hearts to speak with a manager or doctor so that I could file a complaint.  I spoke with Tatiana who told me that Sonia wouldn't be in until 9:30am, and that the office manager Vick and the doctor had a meeting and she would have them call me back.  I asked who is responsible for ordering prescriptions and she told me it would be the doctor/nurse that attended us--in this case Sonia  I called the other location in Gilbert to inquire about where I could file a complaint and said that all complaints needed to go through the Chandler office administrator Vick.  I was transferred to his voicemail.

Vick called me back, and then in a defensive tone he proceeded to tell me that he shows that it was ordered electronically and that they would order it again to make sure it went through.  Who am I to hold responsible, Walgreens or Healing Hearts?  There comes a certain point where you have to take responsible for your errors and mistakes, don't blame the technology when your offices customer service is reprehensible.    

To say the least, my family will NEVER go back after experiencing what happened with Healing Hearts and Sonia.  I would not be surprised if this problem is just tip of the iceberg for the real issues happening there.

While simple, the food is full of flavour. I'd say the best part about Lil Baci is the pasta. It's clearly homemade, and the sauces that come with it are super fresh! Pizza is also very nice as well. Like the pasta, all of the ingredients on the pizza are fresh and delicious. The crust and tomato sauce on are what really set them apart from other restaurants i have been to. My only complaint is that the consistency varies. Some nights the pizzas are perfect. Other nights, the pizza is 50% crust! Even though i have only had this happen to me once or twice, i'm sure there must be some difference in skill between the chefs when it comes to making the pizzas. As a regular, it doesn't bother me too much since i know it's a one off, but it wouldn't be a good experience for a first time customer. 

Service is another strong point. The staff are always very friendly and accommodating, and hustle hard to make sure you aren't kept waiting! The sad thing is that despite their best efforts, i have seen many poor reviews on service. I'm not sure if it's just the neighbourhood, but i feel as if many people who come here are extremely finicky and upset by the most trivial problems. For instance, a waiter brought 3 plates of food to a party of 4, and came back 20 seconds with the other plate. After leaving, the table complained that the food did not arrive at once. How silly! Not only can the waiter not carry more than 4 items, but surely waiting 20 seconds for another plate to arrive is not the end of the world! Before writing this review, i took a look at other poor reviews for this restaurant, and realized that most of them are probably written by the highly fussy crowd that goes here. If my server had not suggest that i write a review, i wouldn't have known about these small complaints, many of which i would not take seriously. As a regular, i can assure you that the food and service is consistently great, and it would be a shame if you didn't go here because of a few sour reviews!",1,xrhmPFMKbcIKK5gsXeA_9g

A group of co-workers and I decided to go there for lunch since four of the five of us hadn't been there before. It seemed like quite a popular lunch destination as almost the entire inside was full. We were seated promptly and had a very nice server.  The menu includes your standard sports bar appetizers, wings, salads, and sandwiches.  There is even a small ""low carb"" section, with some very tasty sounding wraps.  I ordered the BLT and my bacon came out pretty crispy for the most part, as I requested. I liked how the bread wasn't toasted, but grilled, and my crispy fries were delicious.  I appreciated how the sandwich size was reasonable (you know, so it actually fit in my mouth) and I received a nice side of fries, but not too many. Portions appeared to be very reasonable.  With the sandwiches and burgers, you get a choice of two sides, but I only got the fries. Smart move on my part, as two sides would have been too much food for me.  My one co-worker ordered off the kids menu and our waitress was totally fine with that.  For the five of us, our bill came to $52, which is very very reasonable.

I can see how this is a popular destination before Diamondback or Suns games...plenty of TVs dot the restaurant so regardless of where you are sitting, you have an easy view of at least one TV.  Service was quick despite a pretty full restaurant (we were in and out in well under an hour). Street parking was a tad tricky as most of the meters this afternoon were unavailable to park at (not sure why). But if you are going before a game, parking won't be an issue.  The heavy eyeliner on the servers and hostesses was a bit much for me, but fits in the overall theme of the restaurant I suppose.

All and all a good choice if you work downtown and are looking for a lunch place or before a sporting event.  Not sure I would make a special trip to eat here though.

UPDATE (4/20/08):

I have been to Coopers Town a few times since my initial review, most recently today before a Diamondbacks home game. Based on my subsequent experiences after my initial review, I have bumped up my star rating to 4 stars. I have tried a few more things on the menu and I highly recommend the crispy chicken wrap...it is delicious! The atmosphere at Coopers Town before a game is awesome and is a great spot to hit before a game. Plus how can you go wrong with $3 Bud, Bud Light, and Amber Bock drafts on home game days for the Suns and Diamondbacks?",4,ZQYNombDho1PYfnEWFZevw

You wouldn't expect to find such yummy food in a small, nondescript strip mall! I came in for lunch and though they had a sushi lunch special (3 nigiri, CA roll, and spicy tuna roll for around $8) I wasn't in the mood for rolls. I ordered several reasonably priced nigiri including one of the specials: salmon belly. It was pretty busy but my food was prepared quickly and expertly by the friendly chef, and I assume owner, Tony. I'll definitely be back again soon!

A few notes:
* the fish was all very fresh and of good quality 
* the fish and rice was all warmer than one usually gets at sushi bars - just under room temperature. This is a plus in my opinion. Most places give you fridge-cold fish which, while it makes it obvious it was kept cold to preserve freshness and quickly prepared, it makes it a bit bland. My sushi was prepared in front of me and given to me immediately - not left sitting out and as I stated previously, the fish was very obviously fresh. This serving temperature made the sushi very flavorful. 
* the chef puts a smear of wasabi under the fish on most raw fish nigiri. This is important to note because it seems like very few chefs in Phoenix do this. It's the chef's preference but I feel like many local places go for mass appeal and omit this. Just be aware, most nigiri served here  doesn't need added wasabi, just a touch of soy sauce if you like!
* the chef made the battleship sushi an appropriate size. This may seem very minor, but a lot of sushi chefs make their battleships too large to eat in one bite. The very nature of the things, being filled with roe or, in my case, spicy scallops, make them impossible to bite in half without making a huge mess, so it's important to be able to fit the whole thing in your mouth at once. 
* they're currently advertising gyu-don, a donburi dish of thin-sliced beef and onions served over rice. This is classic Japanese fast food but I haven't seen it served elsewhere in Phoenix. It wasn't on the menu but advertised on small signs at the table so this may be a temporary special (fall 2014)",2,k2jCRA6wrDhNmCeua1j7iQ

There are quite a few great dishes on their menu, their ribs are delicious and I'm quite partial to the chicken souvlaki dinner (mmm, tzatziki!). They also have great soup specials - I've never had one I didn't like! 

The best part of Karbouzi though, is the unbelievable service. I will note that going with ""regulars"" might skew my dining experience a bit, but they are just so friendly and fabulously attentive. They remember everyone's name and drink order, they always remember how people like things (""no carrots in your soup, right?"") and are conversational without being intrusive. 

Karbouzi is an uptown gem. Definitely worth checking out!",3,TUu4SppnJ1S3lQ_jTxMpOw

The people watching is very entertaining. Women who were past their due date but proudly display the silicone and gingerly step in 6 inch heels supported by matchstick stems. Men who were overtly comfortable with showing of their fashion palate. Couples who owned the room next to ones who seem more timid than bambi in a forest fire. 

Anyways, still just an exciting atmosphere. The place is split into a long bar, backlit pink and a long set of dining tables seating 2-4. The sakitini menu is impressive and worth a try despite the obvious mark-up.

Foodwise, you're really expecting much? Okay. As for the famed ebi shooter that EVERYONE seems to rave about? OVERRATED. I can see it being novel for some people who don't dine much but seriously, it is an oversized hand-roll with shrimp, tempura bits and a soy wrap shell. If this is their signature piece, they need a new gimmick. Bottomline, avoid it and if you really want, lie and tell people you had it.

Their food is bipolar as well. The hot plates were extremely mediocre. Everything is salted to the hilt. Perhaps the top fell off the shaker? We tried the black cod which was very tender, but nearly salt-infused. The egglant shrimp plate was even worse. Not edible.

Ahh.....but the good stuff. Their nigri is fresh and their maki ($13/roll) are well constructed and flavorful. Especially their orange and black and hotate tuna rolls. Very nice...saved the night.

People post positive reviews here, and that's great. However, here's my rather different experience. 

Went to one artist, who loves Star Trek and has a bald head. Should I say his name or is that too much? Ok. I'll say his name. Smitty... He was supposed to do the tat in ONE sitting for a set price. He finishes apx 1/2, then tells me that I have to come back and pay more. This didn't bother me because he did such a great job (THE FIRST TIME ONLY, it turns out). The (first) tattoo is asymmetrical, jetted out on the edges, is supposed to look like a pattern coming out of the skin. It's a very specific concept and design, and there really is no mystery to what it is or isn't.

When I go back to get the piece completed, he had TWO things:

1) the original print out of the concept/design right next to him 
2) the piece that HE HIMSELF did on the front of my foot/ankle!

On the second visit, the piece was done as I lay on my stomach, on the back of my ankle/leg, outside of my vision. If I could have seen what he was doing, and knew the direction that he was going in, I definitely would have said something to halt the process or switch directions.

The second sitting looks absolutely nothing like the first! ITS UGLY. It looks like a blob, a block. The pattern is simply crammed together thoughtlessly in a blocked blob. It's like he paid attention to detail/design the first time, and the second time he didn't give a flying flick... It's not a lack of competency, it's a lack of thought and it's carelessness. Rushed, only thinking about the dollar perhaps? But with all the work that I'm going to end up getting, it's best to be long term greedy and actually care about the consistency of the design. 

I ended up paying 166% of the original quoted price, PLUS tip, for the reason stated in the 3rd paragraph/segment... so why not take time to care? It's not like I'm not paying you or tipping you. It's not like you've seen me act like uber B__ch, like how I feel like acting now! It's not like I wasn't polite or cordial at the time... Why put something rushed thoughtless and ugly, that looks absolutely nothing like the first beautiful piece, when it was supposed to be an extension of the first?

If there are 20 ways to do one thing, don't take the quickest, most basic, easiest, (and in this case, ugliest) route without checking with the person who has to end up dealing with it. If there's some confusion on the artist's part, it's best to ask what the client wants. If I knew I had to micromanage, I gladly would have done so. As stated above, HE HAD NOT ONE, BUT TWO SPECIFIC IMAGES TO WORK FROM. TWO! 

It's costly and time consuming to get a tattoo removed. Not only does it hurt like a mother-f when getting laser on a bone, but it costs $$$, and you have to wait maybe 6 weeks (?) between laser treatments. So it's months worth of time, more money, and needless pain.

Am I pissed the f off? Yes! If it was an easy repair, I wouldn't be as mad. But it's literally a block/blob, instead of skin showing within the design and this very specific concept. I've been staring at it, trying to figure out a way how to morph it into something else or make it look not so UGLY, and I can't come up with anything except removal. 

Tattoos are supposed to be beautiful. Its art. And if you use your look for your business, have to get a photo shoot done, whatever the case may be, it's even more infuriating. People don't know what media work a person may do, or what publications that they're in... nor do they need to know.... so why assume that the look doesn't have a high level of value IN A BUSINESS/ PROFESSIONAL SENSE??? If you're paying money, the work should be treated like it's going to be showcased in a high level magazine. Not treated like you're going to settle for less, or have no taste. It's tasteless. It's like walking into a poorly designed room with old raggedly furniture. In contrast to a room sleek and modern, with high attention to detail. 

I could write 5 books on this. I could post pictures too. But I'm going to leave it at that. I'll wait for it heal, get it removed, and find a more fitting appropriate artist to work on this long list of tats to add to my current 8. If I was a child or ghetto, maybe this work would be ok. However, I'm neither.",1,Fn0IAeYr3W_CaoF6rGXuEg

It was the midafternoon, so the atmosphere was subdued. Some may refer to this place as a ""hole in the wall,"" but the antiquated interior was much more conducive for large groups than their former location not too far away. During our visit, the green-colored décor included a large mural, blue-checkered floors, TVs, and three rows of tables stretched across the dining area.

Santi and I started with the Ceviche de Pescado ($12.95) that came with slices of tilapia stacked and marinated in lime juice, spices, lettuce, yam, red onions, and Peruvian corn. The tilapia was fresh, nicely seasoned with lime juice without it being too overpowering. The spices were nicely embedded, and accompanied well when eaten with the sharp onions and sweet lettuce. The Peruvian corn and yam were delicious too. At first I was concerned about the portion size, but the fish turned out plentiful and worthwhile. 

We then shared Pollo Saltado ($11.95) made with chunks of chicken sautéed with chopped tomatoes, french fries, red onions, cilantro, mignonette and soy sauce, and a side of steamed rice. The profile of the sauce was on point to bolster the flavors of the chicken. The red onions and tomatoes also nicely contributed to the profile of this dish. The fries were tasty, fried to perfection, and I was glad the cuts were on the thicker side to soak up the sweet-savory flavors. I only wished the fries were cooked down a little more with the onions and tomatoes. It met my expectations.

The Seco de Res ($13.95) was made with stewed beef loin in cilantro sauce, green peas, and served with fried yucca, salsa criolla, and Peruano beans. The beef was very nicely seasoned with wine and other spices. It was nicely stewed, tender, but also had lots of dry spots. The use of green peas gave a nice sweet dimension to this dish. The salsa criolla and fried yucca also have some textures and sharp bites to the refined beef loins. We both loved the Peruano beans. It was nicely cooked down, subtly sweet, and flavorful. 

We were also given a side of roasted Peruvian corn with aji sauce. The sauce appeared more like a chunky salsa than the creamy smooth type I usually find in restaurants. 

The flavors were far-reaching, but there were a number of limitations worth noting. First, unlike most Peruvian restaurants, Tumi does not offer fresh bread as a starter for the meal. Secondly, service was friendly and courteous throughout the meal. But, for whatever reason the server personally wrote the tip into our bill before delivery it to our table, an act I find unusual, offensive, and disrespectful. Ironically, we were going to give her a bigger tip until this happened.

The server did however, give us two coupons for $10 off each time we return to order at least $15 worth of food. Given the nice gesture, I was willing to give her some benefit of the doubt, but it still negatively influenced my rating of the experience.

Interested diners should know that Yelp currently has a $10 for $20 deal at one voucher per table. I would be interested in returning to try their Anticuchos, Ceviche de Mixto, Cau Cau, Aji de Gallina, and Chaufa de Camaron.",28,0juzbrgcLHqobdK-OZAyiw

I do not count the lettuce, tomatoes and other stuff. I pay for the gyro, that is the meat, but I do not think I got the amount of meat that means $8 to me. To be honest, I do not know the weight of the meat, but my guess is it was less than 4 oz, probably 2 oz. You need to tell me buddy how much meat you are offering in your wraps and you should obey your own rules.

In my opinion, $6 for that combo (tasteless gyro wrap & tasteless fries) is more than enough, not a deal of the day, of the week, or the month. If you want to call it a deal, add a free 20 oz drink to the combo and offer it for $6.

Walking into a bakery is quite possibly one of my favorite things in the world.  I love me some bread and the smell of fresh baked breads takes me back to my mom's kitchen.

I seem to be a creature of habit, or at least habitual actions.  Which is probably why I rely on items that I know have not let me down in the past.  Which is the case with the baguette aux lardons.

The Vietnamese Bun with egg and sausage is their tastiest bun, the Kimchi bun is also fun and make sure to try the Pearl rice balls and to as for hot sauce to sprinkle one everything.  You can literally pig out for 5 bucks (cash only).

There were about 15 people eating there. No one was at the front and it took them 5 minute to notice us and another 10 for someone to come over and take our order. Our server introduced herself as NOT our server. Bizarre. It didn't seem that busy. I wanted to ask where our actual server was. Didn't matter, none of my business
We just put in an order for egg rolls as an appy and 2 steals.  1 med and 1 med rare. 

The egg rolls came on top of shredded lettuce that were  old and brown. But since the lettuce wasn't why we ordered it, we just ate the rolls. Our steaks came 37 minutes later (I timed it with my phone) and not only were they Medium well, they were also BURNT. 

It doesn't make any sense to me that it took them that long to grill steaks on a none-busy night and have them come out less than acceptable. If it weren't for my side order of gravy, I wouldn't have even been able to eat it. Pretty much had to pay $80 for nonexistent service, mediocre appy and potentially cancerous meat. 

We usually don't complain about service or food but on the same night, I started to have an upset stomach which kept me up all night and my boyfriend had the same thing happen the next morning and throughout the day.

There was only two nail techs there at the time and when we told them what we wanted they said it'd be about a 15 minute wait until another girl would be in, which was fine. One of the nail techs that had one of the appointments at the time that we came in got my cousin ready at one of the pedicure chairs since she had work in a couple hours. I went and sat in the chair next to her while I waited for more staff to show up. My cousin and I were originally getting the pedicure with all the works, however, when my cousin told her that's the one she wanted the nail tech basically told her that she's just gonna do the basic pedicure because she doesn't have time.... Uhh? Half way through her basic pedicure a third nail tech comes in and continues the pedicure on my cousin while I'm still waiting for what had been about 30-45 minutes. Finally once another girl came in and was able to start my pedicure she seemed grumpy and looked like she just rolled out of bed. She made me feel like she was giving me passive aggressive attitude since she clearly had to come into work early. 

Once I was finally done with my pedicure and moved on to my manicure my cousin was practically done with hers. I believe the manager was the one who was doing my nails, she seemed really sweet and like she wanted to make sure I was satisfied with my nails. She was the only positive part of my time there. Throughout our whole experience there we felt like we were inconveniences due to this nail salon being understaffed. I feel like it's common sense that if you have an appointments for two you should probably have more than two nail techs at the salon.

I've been coming here more for the breakfast than the lunch/dinner with my hubby when we want to just have a nice moment to ourselves and eating outside to enjoy the time underneath the big old trees. I really enjoy their coffee, though sometimes it's a pain to wait for the only carafe available at one time. A suggestion would be to put out some kind of coffee bar like they do with the condiments bar and fountain drinks area (and have more than one carafe of reg/decaf out). MUST COME AS EARLY AS YOU CAN because the lines will be outrageous, especially on the weekends!

Their fresh fruit garnishments are fresh and delicious and I do like the taste of their syrup and Belgian waffles. I'm not a fan of the piece of flatbread they put on the side when you order the meat and potato scramble because it's really just that - flat, but not tasty. I think it's out of place with the rest of the meal. My hubby likes the waffles and fruit (as do I) and the Joe's Big Breakfast. He likes his breakfast with a variety on the plate. Oh! I forgot to mention that the other breakfast I enjoy is the Chicken and Mushroom Scramble - totally fresh and delicious! Since I mentioned the kiddos, they really enjoy the chicken tenders...not greasy, they're flavorful and super super fresh!

We were warmly greeted by a husband and wife team. We were the only diners at the time, he gave us a very thorough run down of the menu items and had suggested the CC Sizzle, we picked Nacho Style. This was delicious. It was a blend of meat with onions, cabbage and cheese over their homemade tortilla chips. Our second item was the Green Chile Enchiladas, made with Hatch green chili's and chicken with creamy chili's sauce. I couldn't decide which one I liked more. 

We ended the meal with Sopaipillas. Probably one of the best I've ever tasted. I like mine with honey, and they had a few different types to choose from. 

This place is really casual. Even if you're dining in, your food is served in styrofoam to go container.

We got a bunch of different appetizers and quite a few entrees as well. I remember the food being good for the most part. The alligator was tender and juicy and the crawfish spinach artichoke dip was so so good. The Tomohawk steak was so amazing and came on a giant bone they let you take home for your dog if you want. The only complaint the first time was the Beignets I ordered for dessert. Im from New Orleans and Beignets are supposed to be fluffy and sweet and a bit crispy and covered with powdered sugar or honey. These were disgusting and hard and falling apart and tasted like gross old overused oil. They were barely dusted with powdered sugar and such a dissapointment. 

The second time I went was Oct 2014 with my boyfriend. I bought a groupon so I thought that would be worth it since their prices are a little bit on the higher side. We had a few of their specialty drinks which were good and had a great amount of alcohol. Then we ordered Gumbo and the Ahi tuna tartare (?) for appetizers. The gumbo was below average. It didnt have very good flavor and wasnt even very warm. The tuna was even worse. It was cut kind of sloppy and jsut drenched in whatever sauce they use on it. For entrees my boyfriend got Jambalaya and I got a catfish and shrimp dish. The Jambalaya was also under-seasoned with a small amount of shrimp which was added for an additional charge. The dish I had with the shrimp was actually tasty but just too small of portions for what I paid (I think about $22). 

Overall, I would probably return again but only if I had a Groupon and only for the crawfish dip or tomohawk steak.",1,ohboKlO6Kg5kBpWhEZF_5g

When I arrived I again mentioned the tire rotation. They took the car in and 25 minutes later I'm presented with the car and the invoice. I again ask if the tires were rotated. Mike G says yes. I pay the bill and before I drive away I get a text regarding doing a survey on my experience at Greulich. It wasn't until later that evening that I'm filing the invoice and some other bills that I even look at what they did. Nowhere does it mention a tire rotation. Three pages of an invoice and the word tire doesn't appear anywhere. Only the oil & filter work and charges. Even if they do a complimentary tire rotation it should state they did one. Plus it gives them the opportunity to tell the customer if the brake pads are worn or need to be replaced soon etc. Nothing. Not a word about tires. Not even we checked the air pressure for you. Fast service but I get the feeling I only got half of what I asked for THREE times!,0,0GdcquNApLjkjpqDa8RQvw

There are a few ponds within the park where fishing is allowed. It's not my thing, but I always see families hanging out by the water.

There's also a facility on site available for rental. I had the opportunity to check it out for an event and there's a very nice bar area and a few rooms that seem perfect for smaller functions like showers and birthday parties.

I have been going to Dr. Bartell for a number of years and I think he provides good treatment. I think he gave me a thorough exam and he resolved my problem and removed some ear wax. (Ewww. I know.)

Cons:
1.) When making my appointment I explained that I no longer had health insurance and I asked how much the office visit would be. I talked to someone in the billing department and they said something like $80 at the maximum, but most likely around $60. When I checked out they charged me $250! So if you're going there with no insurance, be sure to verify the cost at each step... when you make the appointment, at the front desk when you check in the day of the appointment, with the nurse who takes you back and does your intake, and with the doctor when he comes in. It's my own fault that I did not do this myself.

2.) The office could use some updating. The waiting room is very dreary. It doesn't seem dirty, but it doesn't seem clean either.

I'll go back again, but I'll either have insurance or verify with every contact what the cost is going to be for the services.",0,-cH5IqKKfqqgHiRuF-C_XA

We were seated right away and were in and out in less than 45 minutes.  Great, quick service! 

We started with the ""Guacamole Made Tableside"" which was great! The house chips were a little salty, but overall delicious. We devoured it quickly with none left to spare. 

I ordered the ""Pollo Frito"" (chicken) tacos and my girlfriend ordered the ""Camarones"" (shrimp) tacos. We got three of each, so we shared with each other.

I had to ask for my receipt and she seemed irritated. We got the receipt and and noticed a $4 charge. We were charged $2 extra per burger for the choice of Ezekiel bread. It's only $4 and we would have no problem paying BUT it does NOT state that there is an extra charge for different bread on the menu. It actually says ""with your choice of..."" Or something along those lines. AND the cashier did NOT mention that the bread is an additional cost. Again, the money part doesn't bother us but the lack of communication from the cashier AND that the menu is MISLEADING. This is just straight bad customer service and SHADY. We brought it to her attention and she acknowledged that it does not state the extra charge on the menu but it's on her computer so she had to charge us. Hopefully these cashiers will at least be courteous from not on and let paying customers know. She did offer our money back but we declined because that wasn't the point. Also, I ordered sweet potato ""sticks"" and they are NOT sticks. They're cubed sweet potatoes. Annoying. Not worth the $34! I'm all about paying extra for healthy food but when places are shady with pricing and customer service is crap that's where I draw the line. I think Daily Kitchen is WAY better and Greens n Proteins as well.  The burger was good but not good enough for me to ever come back. I hope the owner reads this and takes this into consideration.

3 Lazer Tag: Its lazer tag! It has an upstairs and downstairs. Lots of kids and also adults playing. Awesome thing about the lazer tag is if you get hit your not out!

My dance studio owner was a former dancer herself and was Dr. Crum's patient for two years following knee surgery. 

This is the first dance injury that I have ever received in my life it. I am a 31 year old college student at UNLV who recently re-committed myself back into intense ballet training which is very intense. I have a dance background which I've been on and off on, but primarily in hip hop and break dance, so I expected that my body would be adjusting to such a drastic change and expected that at my age, that injuries were going to be probable. 

The facility itself is very clean, well-kept, and has all the tools and equipment necessary really for any athlete (in my case, dancer) to feel confidant that this is a place that is truly focused on giving you the best quality of service. The personalized attention that I get between Dr. Crum, Alexa and Rose are wonderful and they all have wonderful personalities and are friendly, warm and professional. Dr. Crum and Alexa are constantly on me regarding proper form when during therapy sessions which I have difficulty with only because the movement that I'm doing to get me out of my injury are so foreign to me, but I know that they're making a difference because I can truly, physically feel it. They have a wonderfully motivating facility and an optimum motivating attitude towards treatment.

There are a variety of patients that I see, ranging from the elderly to the young kids, to the next high school All-American to adult marathon runners, all while I'm having my PT sessions. I'm a big, local sports junkie, so I'm happy to see some of his more well known patients photos framed up including Findlay Prep's Basketball team throughout the years. I also REALLY like that he's got a TV going on inside, so I can watch sports while I'm going through my PT sessions. 

I liked that he asked me what my dance goals were, so beyond getting me back to just my normal dance condition, but just overall. After I'm back to normal, I plan on keeping him on to help me be at an optimum operating level in terms of conditioning and flexibility once I'm cleared.

The first time I went for lunch I had the pasta with grilled chicken, pinenuts, and basil pesto. For the most part it was a good dish even though the pasta was a tad overcooked. It wasn't an overly large portion, but was the perfect amount for lunch.  I believe the pasta and a drink was close to $10.  I have also had the Moroccan pizza (pesto, feta cheese, pinenuts, and eggplant) which was very tasty although it could have used a bit more feta. For a slice of the Moroccan, a garden salad, and a drink, it was $8.  Some of my coworkers who I dine with also enjoy the calzone (you will have to wait about 10 minutes for it though) and the Santa Fe pizza.

here's the lowdown:
-king crab legs [both warm and cold] were a tad bit too salty. the forked plastic tool used to assist in yanking out the meat did not help but at least the crabs were pre-cracked [standard these days, anyhow]. just give me a pair of chopsticks, and i can do wonders.

-oysters. no mignonette sauce. aahhhhhhhh! these were definitely not the best, but at least they were somewhat still fresh. since i love ""me"" some oysters, the majority of my plate[s] consisted of these clam shells - with lots and lots of lemon juice. 

-prime rib was somewhat decent. i'm not a big fan of prime rib anyhow, but i'd agree with Pauline C. that it's above buffet quality standards.

-the rest of the fillers were typical. after a few samples, i didn't even bother with the rest. sometimes you can tell how good or bad something is simply by looking at it [or smelling it in my case].

the dessert - probably the only reason why the ratings are so high i'm not a dessert person, but i somehow ended up partaking in a few delicacies. i caved for the presentation alone and indulged in what looked like a chocolate and vanilla mousse cup and gelato. yum!

my conclusion - it's overrated. skip the buffet, and go for something nicer altogether for the same price. your stomach may not be as full but your body will thank you later for it.",5,Fm9zntNS_6n3j_yL73sbdw

The motel was partially remodeled - new parking lot and paint/pictures/linens.  The furniture, carpeting, shower, sink, etc., were all unremodeled.  Everything was cleaned though the toilet, sink, and shower had old stains in them that likely couldn't be scrubbed out.  Oddly enough, the paint job was so bad in the room that it looked like a 2 year old had done it.  Very surprising since it isn't that hard to keep paint along a line of a wall or off the lighting fixture/vanity.  I worried that it was a sign the motel was poorly remodeled.

I was on the ground floor in the middle of the motel.  You park your car right in front of the door, very 1960s and the era from which the motel originates.  But the fixtures inside were definitely modern so it didn't feel sad sack.

Staff was VERY friendly, both at checkin/checkout and also when I called about the bed lights not working.  Unfortunately, that courtesy didn't translate into service since no one ever came to fix the two broken lights after I made the request.  So I had to get up and go to the door to turn off the lights each night - and couldn't read in the bed without the light.

The carpet was torn up and stained, furniture dinged, flat screen TV image was mushy (but there was a nice variety of cable channels to watch, including Showtime).  The internet connection was fast and solid throughout my several-day stay.  The room has a fan that can heat or A/C and it works well and efficiently.  There is a hair dryer and coffee/coffee maker in the room as well.

This is VERY convenient to the MGM Grand, and especially it's convention center.  It's actually closer to the convention center than many of the MGM rooms!!  There is a Coco's coffee shop next to the hotel and Hooters/MGM Grand/Tropicana/New York New York, Excalibur, etc. are all 5 minute walks away.  It also abuts the airport runway.

As a summary, I liked the location and the rooms were clean if not fully remodeled. But the big problem I had, and why I rated this 3 stars, is that it is a very noisy motel.  The first night I was there, it was booked solid for a NASCAR event - so all night all I heard were car alarms beeping as they were clicked on and off, people walking by, airplanes and helicoptors overhead, planes taking off/landing, and especially emergency vehicles going down Tropicana.  Conversations in the rooms next/above mine were crystal clear without me needing to put an ear to the wall - I could have been sitting right with them.  Pipes are old and make a LOT of clacking noise every time someone in any room near mine flushed.  They also had a noticeable whine/hum throughout the day. The other 3 nights it was deserted but still incredibly loud.  I got no sleep at all during the 4 days I was there - turning on the fan helped dull the noise and fortunately the fan wasn't too noisy.

My rate was $39 a night booked through Wyndham (I am a rewards member).  If you are not a light sleeper, the location and cleanliness of the hotel make this an excellent value at the price.  As well, unlike all the casino hotels, there are NO hidden resort fees.  Just the booked rate and state/local tax.  Free wifi, coffee, etc. also really help to make this a great value.",3,aEAmPk-MmL-o6sNYCrX1yw

The fries, always crisp and golden and not too salty, but enough salt to have with the ""Fancy Ketchup"" ! I always grab extra ""fancy ketchup"" here to take home with me.

First, the food... Your run of the mill bar grub -- burgers, hotdogs, fries. You would think the chili would steal the show but it's really pretty bland and lacks that pizazz or spice I enjoy in a good chili. 

Next, the beer selection... Lots of great, local choices on draft. 20 choices, to be exact. I like that they offer flights because I am indecisive and like to sample lots! 

Lastly, the location... I love Brevard Court. It reminds me of a little alley in Europe. It's really an oasis right in the heart of uptown Charlotte. The interior of QCBC is nice, too.

I went here with a girlfriend to celebrate her birthday.  This location is near her work and where she picked to go.  We went in for lunch during the week.  We walked in and it was almost empty, even though it was 12pm.  The host stand was staffed with a guy that resembled a robot.  He was just on auto-pilot and was there to do his job and nothing more.  He wasn't rude, but he wasn't friendly either. He was just there to collect a paycheck and nothing more.  A smile or a hello would have been nice, that's all I'm saying.

We were then seated at a table and waited several minutes before our server acknowledged us, even though there were only 2 other tables in the whole section.  Our server was friendly but ditzy.  He did bring out drinks out shortly after and then took our order.  We didn't see him again until we were half way though the meal. He did bring us out refills at this point, which was nice since we had been out of drinks for almost the whole meal by then.  Again he was super friendly, just an awful server.

Now for the food.  We order the new Barrier Reef Trio with the coconut shrimp, crab avocado stack, and ahi tuna and a steak.  The seafood trio is definitely an appetizer, unless you have a small appetite.  Luckily we had also ordered soup and salad as well, otherwise my friend would have starved.  The seafood was pretty good though except the coconut shrimp were about 5 seconds away from being burnt.  

The steak I ordered medium rare came out medium well.  Ugh, who even eats medium well steak?  Anyway, the steak was overcooked but my friend had to get back to work and we didn't have the time to send it back.  Since I was just going to eat it, I asked the other server (since I couldn't find ours) and the food runner if they could grab some blue cheese dressing (sounds weird but it goes so well with steak!).  They kept telling me ok, but no blue cheese ever came out.  I gave up and just ate the steak because of the lack of time.  I had also ordered the garlic mashed potatoes.  Even these were wrong.  They were so full of lumpy, half cooked potatoes.  I love potatoes, but not undercooked ones.

I am really not a complainer, but this whole experience was just bad.  I still love Outback, but I won't come back to this location, unless I absolutely have too.

Okay, the rice is very straightforward, basically just white rice, but it acts as the perfect foil for the beans. The red beans themselves are cooked until very tender and are served in a thick, luscious sauce. to my mind the addition of sausage is an absolute necessity. Not only does the sausage add a ton of flavor, but it adds a great textural counterpoint to what is otherwise a somewhat uniformly smooth dish. Add some hot sauce? OF COURSE!!! This comes with either cornbread or french bread, both of which are tasty, but I've got to go cornbread with the red beans and rice! Absolutely love this stuff, I get it EVERY TIME!

1/2 order shrimp etouffee: It says spicy right in the description, and it is that, but there's SO MUCH MORE going on here. A known key to this kind of cooking is working from a good roux, and clearly these guys have mastered the roux! There's a silky mouth feel to this dish that makes it exceptionally pleasant to eat. On top of that this shrimp is cooked perfectly, which is surprisingly uncommon even in good restaurants. Not only do the shrimp taste like shrimp they have a great texture. The overall flavor of the dish is excellent and the spice is excellent (and nowhere near overpowering). This is served with white rice as well, which is fine, but doesn't add a ton here. For the ettouffee I think the french bread is the side of choice. the crusty bread is perfect for soaking up that ettouffee sauce! A multitude of flavors here all of which combine to make a dish that's more than the sum of it's parts. This is more than just cooking, it's cuisine! 

Side of fries: They're fine. Basic, but good. Should have gone with the sweet potato fries which are much more interesting (and frankly better). 

As mentioned before, the biggest knock on NOTO for me is the challenge of enjoying a nice sit down meal in the restaurant, but I don't feel like it's fair to take much off for that considering Take-Out is right in the name... 

If you're a fan of cajon/creole cuisine NOTO is a great option in Madison. I'd recommend giving it a shot!",2,cKpl-llJYTY1AdiVCMaK5Q

We were walking around Fremont on a very busy Saturday night, a semi decent band was scheduled to play on the main drag so the place was poppin.  We stopped at my favoriate outside bar which is located at the Golden Nugget and ordered some very large cocktails.  We did the loop around Fremont, and once we got towards the end we decided to grab something to eat.  

Spoke with the bouncer at the door and he said we could seat ourselves.  Luckily they sale their pizza by the slice, so I ordered 10 slices of different varieties (For 5 people) and we waited a bit for it to be warmed up.  Evel Pie is pretty hipsterish, and it was certainly busy but we were able to find a seat.  We probably waited a total of ten (10) minutes and our slices were ready.  

It may have been the booze talking, but this is some delicious friggen pizza.  Everyone pretty much devoured whatever I ordered no questions asked.  Thin crust, great flavors and just solid goodness and not too greasy.  Definitely very close to NYC pizza, and probably the best I have ever had while in Vegas.

Definitely make this place a pit stop to re-fuel, and get something in your belly to compete with all the booze.  Even if you don't drink and are in the area, you better stop by and get a slice you won't regret it.",33,mD8T6tegVU9v06osh8W2sA

Similar to how girls named ""HotChick6969"" in AOL chat rooms were rarely actually hot, or even chicks, for that matter.

Anything a block from the strip is not geared towards locals.  If you really want a locals experience, you have to get far enough from the strip to where you can't walk back without your legs hurting.

We are very pissed off that our stay was very terrible. When we got to our room the power was not working and we notified the front desk of the situation. They didn't send anyone upstairs to fix the problem. So I let the front desk know that I should be compensated in some way about this situation. I notified them that husband's my step dad does work at the Marriott and that I would be notifying him about this situation. The front desk said they would comp my breakfast. Later on that night I came into the hotel and informed the front desk that I lost my key and that I needed a key to get into my room and I also let the guy at the front desk know that I needed to move my car because there was a white suv suburban that was parked right next to my car and they were partying and having sex by my car, and I also needed the key as well to move my car into the garage, where I felt my car would be safer at. 

The next morning when I went to check out and eat the comp breakfast, when the two front desk staff asked the lady manager about it because it wasn't in the note, the lady manager seemed pretty upset that I got the breakfast. Which means the manager from the night before again didn't do his job far as getting me into another room or sending some one upstairs to fix or see about the problem or put in the notes for the next morning that me in my wife was suppose to get our free breakfast. Which takes me to my next problem, the manager reported a false report saying I came to the front desk at 4am saying people were after me, which I never told him that at all. I asked him for my room key and notified him that I lost it at the nightclub and if I may please get a new key. Which again if I said some people were after me, why didn't he call 911? If that was the case if I was in need of help. 

So a week after our stay, (9/10/16) my husband's step dad, who gave us the Marriott Family and Friends Form, notified me that the hotel reported this back to his job about issues with my stay, and let me know that he is very upset with me. I'm very upset that these false reports were made about me in my wife stay and I would love for my step dad name and my name be cleared from these false reports. I would love for his boss to be called at the Monterey Marriott and his name be cleared due to the managers miss handling this problem. My step dad has been working at the Marriott for over 25yrs and I wouldn't want him to lose his job over these false accusations or have him on bad terms with his manager, have his name slandered, and have his friends in family rate forms suspended.

So we get to the club and get in right away and guess what?  There were so many people on that Saturday night that we literally couldn't even cross the room.  I have NEVER been to a club as crowded.  We couldn't even get to the bar to get a drink.  We kind of mentally estimated that making it across the room would've take about 10 minutes..another 20-30 minutes before we actually had a drink in hand.  Another ten minutes to work our way to the dance floor through the hordes of sometimes smelly bodies. The worst part is that the MUSIC WAS SO GOOD!!!

This place doesn't disappoint. When you arrive, expect to be in line for about 45min to a 1hr. If it is a hot day, it will feel like it is longer.  I am not sure how it is on weekdays, but on a Saturday we were in line for about this amount of time. 

The best things to order are the ribs, rib tips, brisket, and hot links. The meat is delicious and one of the Best in Vegas. If you are looking for some good home-cooked bbq, please visit this place, you will not be disappointed. It will be well worth the drive. 

The location of this place is closest to Gowan and Thom which is basically near Craig Rd and Decatur, that is in the northwest area of the valley. You will know when you are there when you see a bunch of cars parked on the ranch. They have tables outside where you can eat and chill too. 

However, if you order the chicken, order an additional meat or get the 2-3 meat combo because the chicken is on the small side for the amount of money you are paying. If you are trying to share a meal, or want to have leftovers, you will need to pair the chicken with another meat to do so. Moreover, if you get the brisket and rib tips combo, it will be enough for two or three days and it will also be more than enough to share with others. 

The side dishes are plentiful when you get them with the combo plate. If you want additional sides, they are very small and a bit over priced. Even though this place is pricey, the food quality does average this out. 

Overall, I give this place 4.5 stars because it is a good place to go for home cooked meals. Staff is nice and friendly. Very relaxed environment and family-oriented atmosphere.",2,sXCTBL0SfvucNjNnGejIEA

And I bet you've never even heard of it. Don't feel bad. Try to ignore my snobby attitude -- I hadn't heard of it either until this past weekend when I accidentally stumbled into it. They've been open for about a year now and I'm hoping to tell all of Cleveland about them so that they will STAY open.

Have you ever seen the Discovery Science television show ""Oddities""? If not, it's about this little antique shop in NYC called Obscura. Any-damn-way, my point is that The Cabinet of Curiosities has lots of the same types of things that you'd find at Obscura. The adorable shop owner told me he bought something he saw on the show and this item is now for sale in his shop -- it was some sort of ocular device (read: torture) used by ophthalmologists back in the day.  

If you still have no idea what I'm talking about.... this shop has some really cool shit. Things you would possibly find at the Mutter Museum in Philly. Or just random things you would find at other vintage shops like antique perfume bottles and the occasional rare kitchen item. But the best example of the items you can find here are creepy old dolls with cracked faces (they have quite a collection!), mounted insect collections, random vintage musical instruments (I saw a sitar in there), plenty of religious relics, old photographs, and zombie dolls/stuffed animals that were made by one of the owners or various artists who may consign there. 

Basically, this shop is KICK ASS and I want you to go there NOW and support this business so that they stay afloat and continue to bring awesome and rare vintage finds for me to ogle and possibly buy!!  OKAY?!",6,WL_U3MBUfTkeHL9lYxoleg

It wasn't terrible by any means, but I guess they've really scaled this back since it began. The selection was not what I expected from the earlier reviews and pictures. There were only 3 kinds of charcuterie meats and 3 cheeses with no crackers. There was no tomahawk ribeye, no Wagyu beef sliders, no street corn, no souffles, no creme brulee, very little in the way of fruit, and only a few tired baskets of fries. I saw pictures here of fried fish, fried chicken and wings. Where were they? Lots of things were missing. I thought they'd have king crab for a Saturday night.

The pros: The crab legs (get the steamed ones, better consistency), the line people/servers/busboys were very nice and helpful (they were 5 stars), the pot stickers, the crepes, the pork belly, the char siu pork, the Peking duck (need pancakes please), and the gelato. The guy that grilled me a corn tortilla was very nice. The ticket for your wait time and text when ready to be seated was very convenient. I liked it even with the 2.5 hour wait. It's easy to kill time and walk around.

The hit or miss: The prime rib. The first piece my daughter got was a perfect medium rare. The second one was tough and un-chewable. The color was off.

The meh: The soup dumplings were small and devoid of broth. They may as well have been more pot stickers.

There was nothing really bad at all. It was mostly very good. I know I sound picky what with all the choices they did have, but this was a very high end, high priced buffet. This is not an every day thing for us and I expected to be wowed. I've had comparable middle of the road price range buffets.

I will say that Frank Marino is really engaging and hilarious.

There are a lot of drag performers performing as stars like: Beyonce, Madonna, Shania Twain, Mariah, Janet Jackson...Cher was prob my personal fav, but all the acts were great.

WHAT ""REAL"" SOUTHERN FEEL IS EVERYONE SAYING THEY GET FROM STEPPING INTO THIS PLACE?!?! 

My husband and I just left this place highly disappointed! So my husband who was hyped about this place (because some other people hyped him about this place) so we decided to give it a try since it wasn't too far. 
It's tucked away off to the W. Warm Springs side of Alberton's...walking in I instantly did not like it. INSTANTLY. It is a small establishment so the minute we walked in we had to walk around a large group that was seated right in front of the door...who does that? I can barely hear any of the ladies greeting us and my husband sure as hell didn't hear them tell us we can sit anywhere we'd like because we stood in front of the register like dummies. Well hello to y'all too!  

When we finally figured out we could seat ourselves one of the ladies came over and handed us the menu...she was bleh as a server so whatever. But enough but about her. We opened the menu and I know my husband was thrown off by the PRICES!!! His statement, ""Soooo...this place is more expensive than Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles. It better blow my fucking mind!"" 

We wanted to use the Yelp check-in offer for 50% off of a 2nd dinner when you buy a dinner. So we chose something off of the ""Dinner"" section of the menu. We ordered 2 fountain drinks at $2.89 each! (Fucking expensive for a fountain drink that comes filled with nothing but ice even if the damn refills are free)...2 orders of chicken and waffles priced at $11.25 each, which we thought was a fair price for ""dinner"". 
We were first served the cornbread cake...which was good but nothing special...you can get this (same flavor and all) from any soul food restaurant. Then the OWNER brings me my food which I thought was nice. So I got 3 pieces of chicken on one large plate with swirls of grease decorating the plate here and there and a separate plate for the waffle and syrup. 

I. Was. NOT. Impressed. 

The presentation of the food didn't even look appetizing and the portions are ridiculously small!!! I sucked it up and didn't want to complain to my husband since he was so hyped about this place. He gets his 3 pieces of chicken on a large plate and we wait for his waffle. I'm not a rude-ass and would never eat if the rest of my party hadn't gotten their food...so we BOTH wait. It took them a few minutes to realize we weren't eating and why we weren't eating and finally one of the waitresses saw and went back to grab his waffle. Thanks. 

I nibbled on the chicken first and realized it tasted exactly like the seasoning that come in the Wai Wai MaMa noodles packages I get from the Asian store. Smh. It was ok...I was just expecting so much more. The waffle was toooooo soft. It just wasn't right. It wasn't a waffle. But the syrup for the waffle was tastey so it kinda made up for the texture of the waffle. 

So we finish eating and get the bill...it came out to $30.57. I asked if we can use the Yelp offer for the dinner...they said NO...""because we didn't order dinner."" Well that's mighty strange, given that the meal we ordered was listed under the ""Dinner"" section in the menu. 

I didn't want to cause a scene...we just decided to never return...and I mean never...not even for a second chance. Hubs didn't want to leave a tip...but I asked him to leave an $8 for the server that helped us the 2nd time around at least...She was very attentive and polite. So that one star is for her and only her.

Here's the breakdown:
Southern Ambience: 0
Food presentation: 0
Flavor: 2 (and that's for the cornbread cake)
Food Portion: -2 
Cost: -2
Southern Hospitality: 1 (for the 2nd waitress)
Crowd: -10 For that rude-ass lady cackling next to us. (But the restaurant has nothing to do with that) 
All around score: JUST GO SOME PLACE ELSE. 

***SIDE NOTE: No Roscoe's out here but Hash House A Go Go has a great chicken and waffle plate...yes it's expensive also...no it's not a soul food restaurant... but at least the portions are GINORMOUS, FLAVORFUL and worth every single penny.***

PS...I wonder if the owner has someone else review and edit her responses before posting them to Yelpers...these responses that I have read so far come across very rude, entitled and always unapologetic... you should work on that and all the above...just my opinion.",10,_73GdBatHqhhQ7fA83WkGQ

We complained to the store manager about the salads and she comped us with a slice of chocolate cake which was delicious. Bottom line until they get their act together, come here for dessert and go to Paradise Cafe for good sandwiches and salads.",3,Bqrzr2aEdi_2hQXghfXGvQ

I alerted the cashier who told me to throw it away and he asked if I wanted something else like a drink. I just wanted my avocado refunded. A better way to handle the situation would have been to not put the avocado there and then ask if I wanted a refund or something else off the menu.

This location has NO customer service and they are rude and disrespectful to customers.  It all started when I went in on a Wednesday to order 1 set of Queen bed rails. The employee by the name of 'Art' at first tried to tell me to go to Costco's (which I thought was strange) then retreated to put me in a order but it had to be shipped from the Teneya location to the Sunset one. I was okay with that so he then printed out a receipt and told me that I can pick up at at 9am Saturday. Saturday came and I called to make sure it was there before getting in my car and driving to go pick up the order. The lady that helped me on the phone, Mirida told me it wasn't at the store yet and to come after 2pm, she didn't know why they didn't ship if off yet. I came in after 2pm and there were about 5 employees clinging to the desk and computer area in the middle of the store. Mind you  the store is completely empty. I was approached by a man in a tan suit and told him I was there for a pick up. He then told me to go in the back at the counter. I went to the desk in the middle of the room and ask where do I get this order the other man said to follow the other guy in the red shirt (that was way across the room heading in the clearance section) I was annoyed at this point and went to the counter in the back of the store to find no one there. The man in the red shirt was no where to be found. I walked back to the middle of the store where there were 7 employees sitting/standing around doing ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. I approach them waited for them to stop chatting with each other and stared at them like they were insane. One of the employees in the group asked ""do you need any help?""

Art, the man that originally helped me was sitting down  and was like ""ok I'll call for Juan."" He then gets on the PA and says, "" uh yeah, Juan these kids up here are here to get their bed rails.""

Bing soo, coffee, AND shakes? I'm in heaven and it's raining Korean style snow! We were looking for a place to have a cool refreshing dessert and someone didn't want bubble tea (Hint, it's not me ;p) so Ice Lab was a good compromise. The shop is a couple doors down from Asian Cafe Express and is hard to miss since it has a blindingly bright white interior inside with a brightly lit sign outside. 

All the selections sounded so delectable but I was set on having something with snow and some coffee. I saw that they offered affogato so naturally I had to order it :). I'm always a sucker for green tea dessert so I went with the green tea snow.

It was a bit mesmerizing watching the gentleman at the counter making the snow. He rotates it around and then adds the green tea sauce in layers, along with some cereal and shaved almonds to make sure there is a bit of delicious lightly crunchy hidden dessert treasure in each bite you take into your colorful sweet avalanche. I was a bit skeptical at the use of Frosted Flakes around the sides and inside the snow but it worked out as a nice textural component while also adding a little punch of sweetness to the creamy snow and green tea flavor. The almonds were a great mix in as well, providing a bit of nutty flavor and light delicate crunch. 

The snow itself was very light and fluffy. We had no problem finishing that dessert!

I also enjoyed the affogato. The espresso was strong and smooth, and the gelato was rich, thick and creamy, a perfect counterpoint to the espresso. 

The gentleman at the counter was friendly and delivered our shake and affogato right to our table.

So apparently you can't book for two people at the same time for a service that takes literally a minute and a half. First frustration, I try to do this and am told that instead I will have to book a second appointment. Ok, fine.  So I do. I arrive on appointment day and explain that if I can't get in at same time as my partner that I needed to cancel the 11:45a that you required me to book because I do not have the time. Instead of accomodating me for a minute and a half service (yes I mention again). We arrived early for check-in for the original appointment I had requested at 11:15a. We waited 11 minutes past the first appointment time. I find it unreasonable that they could not accommodate two people for the same service in 11 minutes. At 11:26a, they call my bf back. At 11:29a he's done and back out. We leave.


I get a call at 11:55 from Kimberley asking me if I was running late, I don't know if she gets confused easily or what, maybe she forgot the interaction 25 minutes earlier. I tell her that they couldn't fit me in and remember i cancelled the 11:45a appointment when I was in at 11:10a. She started on some crazy stuff about ""well our cancellation policy... blah blah"" I hung up, are you serious?

I feel very fortunate to have stayed here, even though it was only for one night. The service was top notch from start to finish, from the valet to the lobby staff. They made us feel welcome at all times and service was always fast, from bringing up the luggage to retrieving our car. 

The room was incredible. We had the ""cheapest"" room available, which is quite a steal during the weekdays, but we never felt like we had anything less than first class the whole time. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was enormous, and it was nice to have a door around the toilet. The most unique thing, that I've never seen in any other hotel because it's considered an ""unnecessary"" luxury, is that they utilize soft water in the sinks and showers. This a high quality extra that is so effective in preventing dryness in your skin. I was so surprised because this is an extra cost for them, for the pure benefit of their guests, and many guests probably don't even realize they have it. I'm aware of the difference in how it feels because I used to pay extra for tanks of soft water to be installed in my shower and I had forgotten how much I miss it. 

My husband and I did a little walking around. The pool area and gym were so nice, we wished we could have stayed longer to take advantage of them. Everything shimmers of gold so we had fun taking pictures all around. We even wandered into an open meeting room. High class everywhere we looked.

This warehouse store (chain) has the best prices on: mostly baby items such as diapers, wipes, aveeno, 2 pack Apple Juice (100% juice), cases of bottled water, chips, baking supplies, cheese, bread, bagged salads, birthday cakes, and floss. Sometimes, veggies, and meat prices are good, too. Samples of food is available on the weekends. Also, there are weekly sample promotions (you scan your card into the self-service machine). And then when you're done at checkout, make sure to stop at the cafe for cheap deals, like the frozen yogurt (triple berry- my favorite!) and sodas.

We had to stop at the customer service line once, and that was a super long time, but since there was only one cashier to help, what do you expect? I also did mention above that this location seems to be very busy, we usually come here on saturdays (our regular one, is pretty much, any day of the week).",1,fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg

The fried fish was way nasty. I'm not even sure I can describe the horror.Second trip just today and I got the grilled chicken sandwich with bacon and avocado. Chicken was, dry,dry,dry!. Shoestring fries where not hot upon arrival. I went over lunch so it was a bit busy both times but come on. The water has a sanitize taste so maybe someone is going crazy on the sanitizer rinse. 1 star because the service was average. Third time will not be the charm.

Ordered a corned beef sandwich a Reuben  2 onion soup and mozzarella sticks for take out was $43.00 asked for xtra pickles on side DIDNT get any asked for mustard on side DIDNT GET ANY asked for xtra 1000 island dressing DIDNT GET IT.  Corned beef was dry and bland bread was stale sour kraut was like eating dental floss! Thankfully they put very very little on it. And cheese was non existent. As far as I could tell neither of us wanted to finish or save what was left of our very small sandwiches. The only good thing about them was that they were small. Cuz if they were really big and had to throw away more than half the sandwich I would be pretty peeved Mozzarella sticks were ok but hardly worth the $$  they charged and somewhat undercooked  soup was only good thing we got.

If you are over drawing/ filling in your brows every morning, tia is the girl to help you! She takes the time to make sure your brows are absolutely perfect and your are 100% satisfied before she starts. Her work area is completely clean and sanitary and she makes sure you are comfortable during the procedure.. the pain is really minimal! Tia really took the time to listen to what you want the end result to look like and made sure that both brows were even. I felt so comfortable and would recommend Tia to anyone who is thinking about microblading! 

6 months later: 
Tia is amazing!!! she originally did my brows in the first place. But I went back in for my touch up.. it was quick and added a little bit more volume and she filled in some areas that has faded..  Microblading is amazing and such a time saver! My morning routine is so easy now that I don't have to draw my eyebrows in! Tia is the best and makes you feel so comfortable during the process.

1. The shop itself is adorable. I love the painting they've done and it's all very clean and minimalist while still being charming. 

2. The service was very warm and friendly. Not the typical vegan hipster elitist type you find often in DoPho. 

3. I got my coworker a red velvet cupcake, and because they're my favorite I got myself one too, just to try out. Because they're vegan I didn't expect to be wowed at all.. I was so wrong! The cupcake was delicious. Very flavorful and pretty true to form for a traditional red velvet cupcake. My coworker hasn't had hers yet, but I'm sure she'll love it.

DON'T DEAL WITH JESSICA IN THE FRONT OFFICE !!!!! I was pre-approved for a two-bedroom unit and went there to follow up on the paperwork I had sent in to make sure it was uploaded correctly to the place called onsite a verification company which they use and  was told to send it to, well let me tell you I never felt so belittled when I explain to Jessica. What I'm here to do and what are the next steps she basically told me straight out didn't they tell you the first time you came cuz if it was from me I always make sure to tell everyone almost like she was hateful towards her fellow employees? Made me feel very uncomfortable and when I explained about the paperwork I sent in she looked in the computer saw that I was already approved and basically told me you didn't need to send anything in? I was very confused so I played her the message that was left to me on my phone from a person at on-site, clearly stated I need it certain documents uploaded. Then when I proceeded to ask other questions I felt like I was being talked down to like if I was stupid! My plan was to follow up on the paperwork and everything I need it to do because my moving date was on the 25th of this month I wanted everything to go right I was very excited because the 27th is my birthday and this was a gift to myself and when I first came and filled out the application and everything I needed to do I felt fantastic I loved the unit I was shown the grounds and to multiple units from a one-bedroom to the biggest unit you have I end up applying for a two bedroom two bath more than what I wanted to but what I saw the place I fell in love with it and had such a good experience was the other office Personnel that were there this is the first time I ever met Jessica second time I've ever been to the office. But I have to let everyone know that if you are to come to The Gallery Apartments front office please do not let Jessica help you I didn't only feel talked down to, felt stupid but most of all I felt discriminated upon cuz it seem like she want it to get me in and out of the office as soon as possible I even came back to ask the correct address building number and unit so I can apply for Southwest Gas and NV Energy but she was running out the door to door car didn't have no time to answer anything told me straight out she had to go it was important and would call me back in an hour or for me to come back in an hour I waited 1 hour in the parking lot never received a call found out the information on my own that's not a way to treat a new customer who is spending a lot of money too move there. Jessica literally took the fun and a happiness I had for this place and it's not fair to the others who had did such a great job and fantastic experience for me I guess her personal stuff was more important then helping a future client!! I wish everybody the best cuz these places are beautiful so please avoid seeing Jessica talk to one of the others with this experience I will never have her help me again if she still there!

Entree - Onion Soup Burger - this was just okay. It was filling but REALLY lacked flavor. It came with french fries which our server said take 3 days to make.
