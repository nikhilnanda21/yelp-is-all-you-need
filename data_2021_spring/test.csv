It's a good thing I left as early as I did because I went to Air Canada Centre to catch my flight. I showed them my ticket at the door and they let me in but then when I tried to find the gate for my flight I couldn't. I did buy some popcorn because I was hungry and it was quite delicious. Thanks to a security guard who wouldn't let me into a private area, I was told I was in the wrong building and that I needed to take the UP train in the OPPOSITE direction. Like I should have known. I phoned Air Canada to lodge a complaint but the person at the other end of the phone told me ""they didn't know what to say."" I told them that's precisely the problem with Air Canada since they falsely named (what I later found out was) a sports arena after an airline. Typical corporations trying to pull fast ones. Probably a tax scheme.",0,9Lglv-v8SRo_S-IyvFBmbw

It's hard to get a table for more than 2 people here! It appears that most people come in pairs, and the only have about 10ish tables, and a high top for about 16 people. Of course, pairs get the priority cause it's easier to sit them down. For a table of four, you have to actually wait for a table of four to leave. If you're lucky, and two pairs leave side by side, you might get seated. 

Last call is 9:30pm, as they close at 10pm! There's also a last call for the dessert place beside them as well.... however, there's no warning for that. After waiting in line and being forced to stare at all the dessert, I didn't get any to lighten this experience and excite my palate after my mediocre experience. 

The Intense Clam Ramen was very good, but the Original and the Spicy Red ramen had a milky base that was unexpectedly strong. The Spicy Red was not spicy at all..... on top of that, as a fan of steaming hot food, the soup was only warm.

The noodles were firm! No choices like the other ramen spots. 

The Clam and Original came with two slices of pork but the Red came with pork bits with some beans. Compared to the other ramen places, this made it fairly overpriced in our opinion. Moreover, stick to the Signatures. 

The Pork Belly with Egg was a good value, and the Karaage was freshly fried. The Tamago was on par - very standard. 

For people who need quick service, they were able to ace that aspect. You can be in and out of there within 45mins of getting seated. Their staff are very nice as well, but I went for the food. So I can't give this a good rating, but I can't give them less than two for the minor pros.",1,z4PBmnPcQnjB92Jyd9CRZw

The waiters were really nice and the service was average 10-15 minutes. A crepe is quite expensive, mine was 11$, but everything here in St-Sauveur is expensive.

It also states on their website that they offer beer, champagne, wine, water and coffee while you get your nails done. The website also states they do hot stone massage. When I got to the salon, I was assigned to Freda and she was nice but didn't say anything throughout the pedicure. I was never offered any drinks, instead I had to ask for a water. She was working very quickly and I think she took a total of 20 minutes on my pedi. There was also no hot stones used.
The icing on the cake was that there is a 75 cent fee charged when you make your appt online which requires your credit card information and it shows you owe the remaining amount at the salon. When I was paying, they charged me the full amount- I mentioned the website fee and the lady said she didn't know anything about it and that fee doesn't go to the salon. I mentioned they should fix that then as it is misleading. She blamed the owners and said ""I hear you"" but she didn't fix the transaction.

NEVER AGAIN and I hope you do not make the mistake of EVER coming here.  They chipped the original paint on my 71 Ford f-100 ranger and They were trying to to make it seem like it was not big deal after they tried to totally deny it.  The scratch looked fresh.  My car isn't perfect but this scratch was on the driver side where i climb in every day and if I see a scratch on my baby do you think I would not notice it especially after I just climber out of it to get it washed and saw no scratch on the side? They then had me contact the manager who i tried calling on different days of the week twice and he only returned my call once only to say he would get back to me and then I never heard from him again.  I then tried to stop by and redeem coupons that were given to me out of pity from the front cashier out of pity because she felt bad I got burned so bad.  They flat out told me I was not allowed to have my car washed here any more.  I told them I did not attempt to get anyone fired or prolong the conflict.  I never got any payment or compensation for the incident but only wanted to get my dirty truck cleaned and make sure it did not happen again.  They kept telling me no and that's where I lost my patience and told the guy I won't be denied by a place that messed up my trucks original paint and gave them the courtesy of not escalating it.  I was pissed and told the guy he was a F-head get your manager or I'm calling the better business bureau on the grounds of improper discrimination. They said they'd talk with the manager and came back telling me they would let me wash my car here but only a hand wash which was ten to 15 dollars more.  I replied no unless you are giving it to me for the price I would pay to get it washed through the machine.  They said no we don't want the same thing happening as last time so you will have to pay the extra money or get the F out of here.  I told them especially after the embarrassment and feeling of prejudice against me There was no way I would pay extra money for their problem.   I asked if they were willing to accepted the coupons I was given last time as a token of their apology for my chipped paint on behalf of the cashier who knew I got burned and knew they handled the problem very ineffectively and in many ways offensive.  They would not accept them because they said they only accept them on Thursdays and I asked if they could call the manager again to see if they will make an exception.  They were unwilling to take the effort so i flipped them off reversed out of their lot screeching my tires and I personally am never coming back.  This is the worst business I have ever witnessed and if you want to keep your car nice, feel like you matter and that you are respected on a business to consumer level do not do business with these morons.  This is not a biased review.  This is 100% word for word a normal review of my account and I need to put this out there so I can save you all from the pain and embarrassment this crooked, unprofessional and in some ways illegal actions this so called business brought to my pride and joy not just my truck but my actual pride and joy.

Since I've had experience with purchasing bulk wine, the owner went right into wine tasting with us (which I appreciated as a similar store in Ossington doesn't have the service). We picked our wine and at under $5 per bottle, we left the store excited yet disappointed as it was a 3 month wait! 

Beer wait = 2 weeks
Wine wait = 3 months

3 months later (aka yesterday), my friend and I received a call and our wine was finally ready. Charles was very accommodating as we asked for a last minute slot and he trusted us that we were going to be done early and told us to head over. The bottling process was very straight forward. They had a machine which filled up the bottles for you and you cork it yourself. If you want your wine bottle to be fancier, you can shrink wrap the top of your bottle. 

Staff was very friendly and the space was big but, we had two other people who were bottling at the same time as well as customers coming through the door so it got a little bit hectic.

There is a cheaper option that provides less coverage and a more expensive option that includes more.

B) They skimped on the Italian vinaigrette on the salad, but I feel like they were doing me a favor because what I did have on my salad wasn't very tasty. The bread was okay, but nothing to write home about. The oil used for dipping the bread into tasted like the stuff you get in gallon jugs at Costco/Sam's Club.

C) This was my first time to dine at Carrabba's, so I went with the classic spaghetti and meatballs (if you can't do that right, I don't trust you to do anything else right either). The meatballs weren't bad, but it was a $3 upcharge to add three of them and they were pretty tiny meatballs. The standard sauce that comes with the spaghetti isn't even as good as the canned/jarred stuff you can buy in the grocery store. My father and I both agreed that it tasted nearly-identical to the Michelina's frozen spaghetti dinners you spend less than $1 for at the grocery store.

I came here as a mingler (is that a word?) and for that purpose the space is far from optimal. Then add a musician that is ok, but way too loud for the space.. which made it incredibly hard to maintain a conversation. Music at this time is background, not the main event. 

Service was awesome though.. a couple of waiters served a group of people that was moving about, and still got every order (to my knowleedge) right - thats impressive.

nYzCr8fcJ2ci4aiB1-hB6w,4,2016-02-25 04:43:26,2,JOhmb5uEPjAY2xsB8OEWAA,"The fiancé and I walk in around 4:00 just after my classes end. He promised me a trip to a bakery since I got an A in Philosophy, and this is relatively close to the CSN campus. We walk in, a tad bit confused as to where to stand (my fault, long day = no common sense), and I lay my eyes upon the most beautiful display case I've seen in quite some time (I'm a sucker for pretty colors and icing). The girl at the front was somewhat new, so I'm not going to criticize the wait or service. We've all been new hires and, frankly, it sucks until you finally settle in. Still, who I presume was the manager, had an awesome personality and waited on us a couple times. She was awesome. So, overall, this was a great find.  

I went insane with ordering for myself, parents, and fiancé. Perhaps not having eaten since the day before had something to do with it. I checked out with a chocolate ""Blackout"" cake, two apple crumble pies, two orders of mac and cheese, a chocolate-dipped french macaroon, a raspberry crumble bar, and the adorable little fruit tart that's free with a Yelp check-in. 

The decor is great, it's very quite, and there's a little vial with fresh flora at every table. Everything is clean and presented in a lovely fashion. It's a very open and friendly environment with a little bar at the front and lounging chairs. It took some time to get what we ordered, but we're patient people and that's no big deal. Again, new girl was sweet and professional - that's what really matters early on. 

The mac and cheese was by far the most wonderful thing there. I honestly don't think I've had mac so creamy and wonderful in my entire life. Absolutely delicious. It is pricey, though. After tax, about $9.00 a bowl; the portions are enough to fill you, but not enough to have for later. Let's just say the fiancé was still a bit hungry afterwards (the pie filled him, so he was happy). Nonetheless, awesome. 

The Blackout cake. At least that's what I think it was called. The presentation was awesome. It was very sweet, and insanely rich. I had about a fourth of it and took the rest to go. But, it had great flavor, and it was an awesome dessert (in small quantities). 

Apple pie. I bought one to-go for my fiancé and another for my father (we'd be seeing him later). The presentation was so cute. I loved the portion size and the price was great. The fiancé loved it (he's not even that big into apple pie). The apples were baked to perfection, and still maintained a slight crispness. The crumble on top is phenomenal...no really, it's great. Now, my father is an apple pie connoisseur, of sorts. He really liked it, but it's not the best he's had (that would be in a little restaurant out in Boulder City). I still believe that's an impressive feat, despite his criticisms. 

The raspberry crumble bar is tasty. The raspberry is a little powerful, but it uses that same crumble topping as the pie. The trouble was that I didn't order it. I'd purchased a strawberry cheesecake to-go, and found this little cutie inside instead. No big deal, it was alright. The same with that cute little tart (check out the pictures, it's adorable). Nice presentation, and the berries were incredibly fresh without that odd glaze topping that adds a sort of artificial taste to good fruit, as though a preservative. The macaroons are good. As expensive as any other french macaroon in Vegas. Honestly I'm not sure why there's hype about macaroons in general...they're cute and sweet, but I guess I'm missing something. 

As a response to a previous one-star review: I got paper beneath the desserts in my box. Not sure what you did to fluster the girl enough to just throw your cake in, hoping you'd leave. Or maybe she was new? Who knows.

Usually, Gemma would answer, sounded busy, and would tell me that me would call me back - which didn't happen until the fifth try. When I showed up, the Suite # listed on the groupon was incorrect and there was no way to locate her suite as the name in her door does not read ""Spa DG Couture"" (which I what the groupon said). I had to find another shop owner who kindly showed me the way. AND THEN, she wasn't even there. I tried calling her TWICE, she finally called back 17 minutes after my appointment time and asked if I was ""at her other shop."" Seriously?

I was a new college grad with student loan debt and wasn't looking to go into further debt. Long story short, the doctor pushed veneers on me and I was dumb enough to do it. Little did they know, or care, that I had been through so much orthodontic work as a child--braces, bonding, etc.--that my teeth were in a fabulous place... only for him to drill them down to nothing so he could make a quick $10,000. I'm ashamed at my stupidity and miss my teeth every day. They don't tell you that you shouldn't have veneers when you have issues with your bite, experience night-grinding or have had extensive dental work. It's an irreversible procedure and a lifelong expense. Now, I can look forward to replacing them one day and all I can hope is that it will be a far less painful experience. He even had to use resin to fill in the gap where some of the veneers didn't cover my teeth perfectly, which was causing unbearable sensitivity or bacteria buildup. They should have been redone, not patched up for that kind of money. Don't get me wrong, my smile is very pretty and I get tons of compliments, but I paid a high price in more ways than one. Here's a fun fact: Dr. Wilson isn't even accredited by the Cosmetic Dentistry Association. So if you're looking for a great general dentist (or even a credible cosmetic one), look elsewhere.

The employee by the name of 'Art' at first tried to tell me to go to Costco's (which I thought was strange) then retreated to put me in a order but it had to be shipped from the Teneya location to the Sunset one. I was okay with that so he then printed out a receipt and told me that I can pick up at at 9am Saturday. Saturday came and I called to make sure it was there before getting in my car and driving to go pick up the order.

I went to the desk in the middle of the room and ask where do I get this order the other man said to follow the other guy in the red shirt (that was way across the room heading in the clearance section) I was annoyed at this point and went to the counter in the back of the store to find no one there. The man in the red shirt was no where to be found. I walked back to the middle of the store where there were 7 employees sitting/standing around doing ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

I feel it's important to identify the particular waiter who was so odious. I don't know his name, but he was very tall, had a shaved head, a beard, and wore a bow tie. His colleagues were fine, but he was simply atrocious.

We went for dinner on a Friday night with a group of 3. I had reserved by phone three weeks ahead of time, but when we got to the restaurant they had obviously lost our reservation. The aforementioned waiter didn't apologize, and instead condescendingly informed us that, ""you will wait 20 or 25 minutes, you'll have a drink, and that's all."" He then ignored us, not even coming back to take our drink orders. Thankfully a waitress noticed that we were just waiting around and saved us by taking care of us for the night. She seated us right away and got us started on dinner.

The food was interesting and mostly well-executed. We had elk carpaccio, jerusalem artichokes, and whelks to start (all good, though the ""wine syrup"" overpowered the carpaccio), and venison steak, seafood pot-au-feu, and cabbage pierogies for mains (mostly good, but shockingly some of the pierogi dough was raw!). I felt like some of the assemblages were a bit haphazard; some dishes felt like a random mix of ingredients without much thought put into how they should be combined. Portions were normal.

The horrible waiter visited us at one point in the dinner to put his hands on the backs of two of our female dinner companions(!) and asked us, bizarrely, ""Are you happy?"" We were shocked. Thankfully, he never came back.

We didn't stick around for dessert or coffee as the poor service had soured us on the restaurant. The music wasn't too loud, which is a nice change from most places in Montreal.

I won't ever be going back or recommending this place to friends. It's a shame, because the kitchen shows some potential. However, the management desperately needs to gets its act together with regards to customer service.

Came here one Sunday to fulfill a fish and chips craving. I have never been but have driven by numerous times and was always curious.

Dated diner feel inside, with wood paneling on the walls and a bit dank and dim. Don't expect anything fancy. Not too big but we were able to get one of the last two empty tables around noon on a Sunday without a wait.

Reasons for only two stars:

1) Price - ridiculous. One piece fish and chips is $19. Two pieces is $35! This is insane for a diner meal. Yes, the portion is quite big (mainly fries tho, the piece of fish is large, but not large enough to warrant the price). I wish they would slim down on the hefty fry portion and then slim down the price with it. Although it was good (good. not great) (also - fries were overcooked and not hot) and gave me my fix was definitely NOT worth $19. 

2) Tartar Sauce - if you advertise as a fish and chips joint and charge insane prices for said fish and chips, at least serve some proper tartar sauce. Doesn't need to be 'house-made' but get a pre-made tub of good stuff like other restos do. Instead they serve those nasty solo packets that you would get in a food court setting which imo is the nastiest tartar sauce out there. But for real - if you are charging me $19 for one piece of fish and chips, you better compliment it with proper tartar sauce...

3) DON'T SIT NEAR THE BACK!!! - we learned this the hard way. Aside from it being very cold in the back, it is also right beside the back door, which is also the door to the washroom. And every. single. bloody. time. someone exits or enters you have a nice huge whiff of OUTHOUSE stank. Smells like musty sewer and the smell is overwhelming. How can I enjoy my overpriced $19 fish and chips with crappy tartar sauce while smelling and almost tasting TOILET& SEWAGE. Believe me. it's tough.

4) Service - tbh it wasn't terrible and they were friendly enough considering it IS a diner. But it lacked in a lot of ways. When we entered, instead of smiling at us or guiding us to a table or simply telling us to 'take a seat anywhere' the waitress who was holding a broom and sweeping just looked at us annoyed and asked us to move, as she wanted to sweep where we were standing. Not sure what to do we sat ourselves at one of the two last remaining empty tables which was covered in droplets of milk. We then waited 15+ minutes to even get a menu. We encountered the same wait time when trying to get a container for the leftovers and the bill. Yes, it is a diner. But if your 1 piece fish and chips served with fake tartar sauce and a side of bathroom is $19, I think you can up your service just a tad.

The food was average and my eggs Benedict tasted like they had been sitting there all morning just waiting for me to show up, that or the A/C seriously cooled it down before it made it to my table.  The earthy Benedict was rather tasty (as there was bacon in it!) and in general I'd say the food presentation is decent as well. How was the service? Nice and slow... So you better get a good window seat to enjoy the view while waiting. I would say that it's better to go to the resto and get food and a complimentary view than just to go to the observation deck alone so I would say it's definitely worth a visit.",1,1hJQYk3NiajdYK58TQi9EQ

We went for the Las Vegas Dining Out week that is supposed to benefit local charities. We got there at 11:20 am on a Friday and were told there was a 20 minute wait for lunch. FML!  OK give my cell phone number to the hostess who puts it into her snazzy iPad then we go sit.  

We wait, we wait, we wait some more. Finally I get a text message our table is ready. While this feature is really cool here's where it goes all wrong.  Only one hostess behind the stand [not good]. She's on the phone....there's a long line of people waiting to give their information to her...we walk to the front of the line to claim our much anticipated table.  Guy in line starts yelling out us for cutting the line!!!  So it sure does appear we were doing that, how would he know that the table is on my phone and it's indeed our turn to sit, not a good way to start the meal after long wait time already.

We sit down. We ask for the Las Vegas Dining Menu.  Which is difft from what's on the site, but OK no biggie.  It also wasn't offered to us???  boooooo   PS- We are spending a fixed cost of $30.12 for lunch that's how this deal works so we aren't expecting to have a 'cheap meal' here.  

They mess this all up from there on out.  Meals came out before apps, apps came out 1.5 mins before meals, there wasn't enough room on the table, the place is cramped so people keep knocking into our chairs, purses are falling on floor, waitress is blaming kitchen b/c this promo just started [which she thinks we are dumb b/c it hadn't just started], too much food on the table, blah blah blah. This list goes on and on and on.

Appies were fine, nothing exciting.  Tomato & Mozz salad had the blandest dang dressing I've ever tasted and HELLO this type of salad needs kick b/c it's very bland to begin with.  Chicken Sandwich was soggie and the bread was ALL wrong. I dissected it like my science project frog and ate parts of it somehow.  Chicken Salad Sandwich got the 'wouldn't order it again' from my boss.  

The best part of the meal was ---Ding Ding--Dessert!  it was by and LARGE the best part of our experience. SO, if you eat here [I have pix that I posted] only get dessert.   But if you don't have to eat here HEAD OVER TO SUGAR FACTORY, you'll be happier :)",1,8QKrhvVqhEkD8xo4E4s0GQ

Great tasting craft beers along with exceptional seasonals.  My two favorites being Mr. Pineapple and the Winter Warmer.  But you can't really go wrong with any of their beers.  Also, the food is fantastic.  Their pizzas are great and well pretty much everything else is tasty as well.  

I love the location in downtown Chandler.  The eclectic, artsy vibe down there is quite refreshing compared to the Mill Ave / Old Town Scottsdale one.

The atmosphere is sort of fun-loving with a cute minibar at the front of the restaurant and seating arrangements spanning from patio, main floor and second floor. 

The service is almost non-existant...You have a server appear once and then never again. You are perched or famished or something but no one is in sight...You can hear staff laughter or see them sipping on a beverage while you try to control your own thirst for water or coffee or tea. If you have a table to wait on, why are you not doing so? Of course, I am not suggesting to constantly be on the lookout for what to do for your customers but some semblance of thoughtfulness of bringing over the menu or a glass of water really goes a long way!

The food is inedible. My go to was always the Blueberry Hill. However...Once it was slightly burned which I excused and simply ate. The second time was completely burned. Each pancake was covered in burnt pieces of dough...There was an attempt to conceal it with more blueberry compote but failed miserably. I had asked to replace it and was denied. This ties back to the notion that customers are not the priority here but rather maintaining a relaxed attitude is. Again all we diners ask is that our food is cooked well (or even decently or maybe even considered edible) because we pay for your services and your food. You hurt your customer's trust in your product by displaying certain things and frankly, this is not my recommended anything anymore.",1,D4fp_dBszPtWwpfUcRuvbQ

Me, my fiancé, and her mother went to Le Mont for dinner tonight in hopes of locking down a date for our wedding venue next year. Well, I definitely would have thrown my money at them if I wanted countless disappointing memories and an over the top, pretentious, unprofessional, outdated venue.

Le Mont reminds me of a restaurant that made it big in the past with presumably good food, service, and professionalism while of course being complemented by the unmatched view of Pittsburgh. However, complacency must have set in because all of those characteristics were lost along the way.

Upon arrival, we were not greeted with even a hello. We were standing waiting for our table while one of the staff members motioned over to us (while standing deep within the restaurant) to come follow him. If it wasn't for my fiancé paying attention his efforts would have been useless, while remaining devoid of professionalism.

Our waitor clearly lacked proper training for a place of this caliber. Nothing against him, but if you work hard during the week to go to a restaurant and pay hundreds of dollars for dinner, you would like a waitor that is professional, knowledgeable about the menu, and attentive. For example, he asked me if I would like another cocktail as it was 3/4 finished. I said yes as I proceeded to finish it; meanwhile he waited behind me as I finished the drink and said: ""Oh I'm just waiting for you to finish so I can make you another drink in the same glass."" WHAT!??!!?

I ordered the filet mignon and said I wanted it between medium and medium rare. His response: ""Well I'll just have them cook it medium rare and if it's undercooked for you I'll have them cook it a little bit more."" WHAT!??!!

The side vegetables were 100% frozen and just came out of the microwave, and lacked any effort of seasoning to help disguise its origin, the grocery store shelf.

When it was time for dessert, they brought out a food cart of half eaten cakes that looked like they had been raided by a hungry pack of wolves. But, in any attempt to salvage the night, me and my fiancés mother ordered a slice of cake. The waitor asked my fiance if she wanted anything and she said no because she was full. His response: ""You sure you don't want nuttin?"" WHAT!??! 

I ordered a cappuccino which lacked foam and had burnt coffee inside. To top it off, the plate was ""beautifully garnished"" with a shriveled, small, dirty, lemon peel. ""Yes, I love lemon with my coffee."" When I confronted the waitor about it, he indeed confirmed that it was a garnish. WHAT?!?!?!?!!? 

The bathrooms were dirty, floors were sticky, wall paper was peeling, and outdated. On the way out, no ""have a good night, thank you for coming, etc"" was said. Pretty fitting though - with this poor excuse for a 5 star restaurant I would expect nothing more: lack of professionalism, mediocre precooked food, and ridiculous comments about lemon peels, but definite willingness to take your money.

STAY AWAY FROM THIS RESTAURANT. IT NEEDS GORDON RAMSEY, OR A BULLDOZER. SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ELSEWHERE.

JUST GOOGLE THE VIEW.",16,1h6YEViaFaRvtOC96YSqgw

They added a few dilapidated shelves near ""express"" checkout with odd items like carton-sized gold fish cracker boxes and adult diapers.

The seating is minimal and weird. To be honest. However, the food makes up for it times a million.

You go in to this weird little kitchen area that looks odd and industrial and you order. There's only like, 3 things on the menu so it's pretty easy to choose. I recommend for the first visit do the 1/2 and 1/2 with the works. Then you can decide which one you like better. My meal with a drink was $10. I can accept that!

We went and sat down at a tiny table. It was lunch time and school is in session so it was a bit packed, but we were still able to find seating for the three of us. They brought us the food relatively quickly which is really nice when you're on a one-hour lunch break.

It was phenomenal! I mean, it looks and sounds so plain but for some reason it's like... the best dumplings you have ever had. Just wonderful. And it's super addicting. I actually crave it. It's a fun little experience and it's something different that you can't get anywhere else in the area.

My wife's parents had plane issues and we had to cancel one of the nights we had reserved for them. My wife called the gold coast and explained to them that this was our wedding weekend and the issues some of the guests were experiencing with flights. The next day when they arrived we went with them to the front desk to help with check-in. Brittney the front desk attendant was extremely nice and had been informed that this was our wedding weekend. She upgraded my in-laws to a beautiful sweet I'm assuming with the idea that they would trade us rooms. Her assumption was right and My Wife and I were able to have an absolutely beautiful suite for the last two nights of our stay. Both rooms were beautiful and well taken care of.

-Berry salad with lemon cream. Might sound strange, but the lemon flavor is very faint. It was more sweet than sour!

The first time we tried to have dinner at Superica, on a Saturday,the wait was more than an hour and we left. Cut to the following Tuesday, my coworker and I decided to pow wow after work and I suggested we try Superica again. We had back up plans prepared just in case. Turns out we were super lucky to be seated right away and we secured awesome parking easily, too! 

The atmosphere was very different than other places in Charlotte. We joked that there should have been tumbleweeds crossing on the video that was playing on the projector. The restaurant has great attention to detail from the complimentary matches to the beautiful bathrooms. 

We each ordered a drink and got down to business with the menu. The sangria was not very strong but I would recommend their house blended margarita. Sneaky, sneaky. One more and I would've been giggly all night. 

I love that we received chips and salsa to start. The chips were crisp and thin, both salsas were fresh and added flavor to our meal. The presentation of the salsas with descriptions of each was a nice surprise. Not just a filler item, no stale chips and jarred salsa here. We each ordered fajitas with queso fundido to start. It was an insane amount of food. You are definitely getting what you pay for and can choose to share an order of fajitas between two people. The mixed fajitas with shrimp would be my top choice for the shrimp alone! Each shrimp has a sliver of jalapeño tucked into the backside and then wrapped in bacon and I'm assuming deep fried. Ooh... just give me those skrimps! The queso is worth the hype and is great on its own but there are options for toppings. Both plates came with warm tortillas. The fajitas come with an array of toppings, rice and beans with cheese. Do not skip the beans. I ""don't like"" beans. Mm-hmm. Not anymore. Superica's refried beans are topped with cheese and popped under the salamander to become a melty, toasty, dip-able side. Friend, turns out I like refried beans. 

Make sure to check out my picture of my to go box. I'm not kidding when I say I had a ton of food. I went home with enough to eat another meal. We spent a pretty penny: $108 before tip for two with an app, 2 meals and 4 cocktails. And still I say I can't wait to come back!

This isn't gourmet or fancy food. Just good old fashioned regular food at decent prices. I actually liked the fact I could get French Toast and Bacon for $5 off the Kids/Those who don't eat much menu. The plates I saw come out were full of food, more than I needed. 

French Toast wasn't on fancy bread, just regular, and the bacon was tasty. It was good and served with plenty of butter and syrup. Exactly what I was looking for. Iced tea was that type that lacked flavor so maybe skip ordering that. 

Nice decorations with lots of friendly signs saying things like ""Love Laugh LIve"" and similar sayings. Two TV's to watch the football games overhang the dining area. The cook was a nice lady who gave me a smile and told me she'd get my food out quick and she did. Bonus points there.

The restaurant is just over the bridge to Southend and actually has a nice view of the city but they score points for offering parking! That's always a win when you are close to the city. 

We entered the restaurant and the hostess opened he door for us with a warm greeting. We were offered a large comfortable booth and our server approached the table quickly to be introduced by the hostess. 

The servers wear paper bow ties and full button down shirts... weird. The atmosphere is of course very rustic and they have a story of an old tobacco house on the back of the menu. It's very dark in the restaurant, mostly lit by candles. They have nice fire pits outside but it was a little too chill for us to venture out there. 

We ordered a bottle of wine for the table. Our server turned the bottle presentation over to a different sever and she broke the cork. They panicked and ran form the table to the bar. I think this flustered her but during a wine presentation you present the cork to the host (or taster) ESPECIALLY when the cork breaks. She didn't do this and I requested to see the cork prior to her pouring. The bottle was fine and we did enjoy it but our server needs to learn to open bottles for her own table.. I'll give her the benefit of the doubt and assume she was new.

We showed interest in the Fried Green Tomato app and asked the server about it. She told us it was 2 tomatoes and said it wasn't a great choice to share for our group of 4 but we moved ahead with it anyway. First of all I think all apps should be served with enough for 4 ppl to have a taste. Let's be real that's kind of the point, to share with a group. It was small but it actually had 3 tomatoes and it was topped with crab so we all got about 1-2 bites. The flavor was really nice and the dish arrived promptly. 

We placed our order, 2 people ordered the fried chicken and 2 ordered the shrimp and grits. Our table also ordered sides of fries and Mac and cheese. The food was served in a timely manner. The shrimp and grits was presented nicely and reviewed very high from our friends. I was a bit disappointed in my friend chicken. First of all the dish is $21 dollars and it comes with one side of creamed corn. The portion is way to small for the money. I think that it should be a two piece dinner. Also the chicken was very crispy which was nice but it was very dry. I HAD to use the dipping sauce because it was so dry. The dipping sauce that comes with it is a jalapeño honey sauce which is ok but the bright green color was a little off putting. The Mac and cheese was really quite delicious, very creamy.

They do bring bread to the table and the bread was really great and was served with honey butter! Make sure you try this! 

Overall the menu is a little bit limited so I may give this place another try but they are trying to be a little more fine dining than they are. Your food has to stand up to the price tag and the atmosphere.",4,uy4oHzC_4zqEAn95Kv27Ag

It has all the famous golf holes from Scotland.  First off the when I drove up to the gated course it gave me impression of a private course.  The service was impressive and the guys work quick to get me teed up without delay.   Again on par with a country club. 

The course is in great shape and with no houses or building visible from the courses you almost forget your in Las Vegas.   Fairways are rolling with deep bunkers strategically located to catch missed shots.  However if you look at the course map you can get around these with well placed shots.  The sides of the fairways are hilly and have that long grass as hazards.  The fairways are pretty wide open so making it onto the short grass is very possible for most of the round.   However the rolling hills throughout course adds challenge to the middle of the fairway shot.  But it's straight forward traditional golf which I like best!  

The greens where fast, fast and true!   They broke like they should and required the right touch. Like the fairways they also had some ups and downs you had read before making your putts. 

All in all a very fun golf course and one I would play again on a future trip to Vegas.  If you played a lot of desert courses and want to try something different this is the ticket.   And it's a great way to get a taste of the Scotland experience.",0,9LTX9tC5iwT-s-7Ner7joQ

This place is a bit different since you have to pay upfront before going into the buffet. It is also easy to miss because it is located in the Hawaiian Marketplace Plaza. You have to go into the main building next to the Chili's and just ignore the rundown shops on the first floor as you ascend to the second level where this restaurant is located.  

They have a good selection of food like naan, butter chicken, basmati rice, tandoori chicken, and some other items. The naan is in the buffet so you can grab as much as you want when you want it! The only downer is that it is plain naan instead of garlic, but it still tastes fine since you can just eat it with the curry for flavor. 

I'd recommend checking this place out if you like Indian food and want a change of pace when it comes to eating on the strip. The lunch price with the Yelp discount was about $14-15/ person which isn't too bad considering the food and location.

Perfect sear on the scallops and the pasta is came with was cooked perfectly al dente.  I also recommend the fried gnocchi - I know!  The main reason we ended up coming here was because of the fried gnocchi.  So good!

Just about as dumb as you can get.

Edit after the response of the restaurant's manager:

First, it is good to know that management is reading these reviews (and responding). I hope it makes for a better experience for diners.

It is difficult, at best, to figure out how closing the windows on a nice day solves a problem with the air conditioning. Speaking without hyperbole, it was at least as nice outside the restaurant as it was inside.

And sitting on the other side of the bar, which was open, is a magnificent idea. Too bad that we were first told that ""it wasn't open yet"" and the hostess offered to let us know when it was while we waited at the bar, which we did. Eventually, we gave up and moved to a table so we could eat after again being told it wasn't open. Minutes later, we watched dozens of people move to the cool, comfortable and enjoyable side of the restaurant while we waited for our food. No hostess or wait staff offered to help us move. We were certainly past the point of caring by then.

Washingtonians, don't expect anything in the vein of Toki. This is not that type of restaurant. I feel like the dishes here are more akin to what you can find at Honey Pig Izakaya. While tasty, the food doesn't quite have the finesse of some DC joints with Japanese menu offerings. For instance, Tom N's ramen broth lacked the complexity of Toki's, and you can tell that the broth didn't receive the same amount of TLC as the DC hot spot's; however, all the required fixings were present and the flavors were still good, though not exceptional.

Their rendition of dan dan mian, on the other hand, is quite unique and tasty, though again not necessarily sophisticated. I was so relieved that Noodlecat's version of the popular Chinese dish was meatless (dan dan mian often features pork) and actually was light on the peanut sauce, or maybe omitted it altogether. Don't get me wrong, I love A&J's peanutty dan dan noodles, but it's nice once in a while to try something different. Noodlecat's take featured chili oil and soy sauce more prominently. 

Besides the food, we also enjoyed Noodlecat's casual vibe and friendly service. Clevelanders and non-Clevelanders alike can definitely have an enjoyable time here.Though the food isn't amazing, it's still good, and hits the spot when you want some flavorful noodles or indulgent Japanese drinking snacks.",4,UhzrTq9-Sggy1SHkSY4Unw

And sadly, that was the best part of the meal. The waitress had the personality of a wet noodle with no smile, short answers, and not friendly at all. She wasn't unfriendly, just like I said...a wet noodle. 

The chips and ""salsa"" came. We tried the hot, but the waitress was right in calling it smooth. It was blended, had little flavor, and was literally and figuratively cold. As if it was in a fridge. The regular salsa had little flavor as well.

Then came the menu which was set up nice until I saw the prices and the size. The prices were easily half again as most places with portions half the size of the better and cheaper restaurants. 

We got a ""bean and jalapeño"" dip that had no flavor whatsoever. We mixed in the ""hot"" sauce in an attempt to salvage it. It got a little better. 

So I ordered my usual go to at a new Mexican restaurant. Flautas with refried beans and rice. The rice was ok. The beans actually had good flavor, but the tiny little flautas were bad to the point of I just stopped eating anything all together. 

Then on top, they over charged me!

All in all those of us at work feel the food here is just okay. The ingredients are mediocre. If I could make a comparison for food quality I would compare Venezia's to Pappa John's.

At work we only go here when we get tired of all the other places we can get delivered. I would suggest you can probably find better in the area of north east Mesa if you look a little online.

Note* I came to this company before but at a different location to pierce my son's ears and they did an amazing job. Which is the reason I chose the same company to do my daughters ears.*
1. They told me they would have to do one ear at a time. This was already a red flag and should've walked out. I told her, ""I never heard of having to pierce one side at a time. My son got his ears pierced by your company and they did both sides at the same time"". Still refused to do both sides at the same time. They said it's because she's so young they would need to do one side at a time. Nope! Still wasn't convinced. All my other friends who got their baby's ears pierced had it done at the same time. 

2. The girl marked my daughters ears with the marker and kept marking her right ear completely off from the left ear. Finally I told her just pierce the very edge of where she marked, since the edge of the marker is exactly where I wanted the piercing. She said okay. NOPE! She pierced 2mm AWAY from where she marked! UNACCEPTABLE!!!!! My daughters piercings were completely off!!! She said nonchalantly ""oh I can do it again"". No remorse or apologetic at all. My 3 month old daughter is crying in pain. Well my boyfriend says we can't walk here with crooked ears! She takes out the piercing and marks it again. I kept telling her it was off. My boyfriend was getting fed up. I was getting fed up. Now she marked in the area I liked but it was too close to the edge of her ear lobe. I told her I want it in this area you marked but further away from the edge of her earlobe and more up! Like what couldn't she comprehend?! Then she backed mouthed me and said ""that's where I originally marked all along!"" First of all, who are you to be talking back to a customer?! Second of all, No you didn't! Because you ended up piercing completely away from where you marked to begin with! But obviously you don't care because she's not your baby, and you're not the one going through the pain, you childish little girl! 


I'm still very dissatisfied with my daughters ears. I will wait until the swelling is down to see how they look but I really think I will be taking them out. 

Icings management, don't have a employee be in charge of the piercings if she's hesitant and doesn't know what she is doing!!",3,bnjrpLOppJMNQfanTnuuPQ

Hubby and I ate a couple of weeks ago for lunch - we loved it.... the food, the ambience, the service was awesome....  

We took our 23 year old daughter last night (around 4:30) for early dinner because we wanted her to try the jackfruit barbacoa.....  We walked in and a young lady was cleaning off the plant stand.  My husband had opened the door for us and he asked her if she was going out (she had plants in her hands) and she said, ""No, I work here.""  (We knew that!)  Then told us to find a seat.  We sat down, she continued to clean up the plants and told us the drinks were on the back the menu.  After she was done with the plants she came over and asked if anything looked good.  I told her it all looked great and she said, ""Drink-wise.""  The three of us ordered lemonade (which is delicious!)  We ordered our meals and we all loved our food except most of our potatoes were undercooked - way undercooked.   My husband also had to ask for the two sides of pickled jalapeno we had ordered.....  Our server seemed upset.  Not sure why though.  I had a feeling that our server was having a bad day or something was upsetting her and I decided not to take it personal, enjoy my meal and ask her how she was the next time she came around.....  However....... I changed my mind when another table of three young men came in.......boy, she was right there, got their waters and lemonade and even helped them when they spilled their water.  

We were never asked if we wanted any re-fills on our lemonades.  The table of young men were offered re-fills.  (When we had come in for lunch previously- we were offered re-fills several times!)    

We asked for a to-go box for our daughter's sandwich but our server took the picked jalapeno before we had a chance to put it in our box.  (We were charged extra for the jalapeno because it is an additional side dish).  

We paid, and we left a tip, but we will not be back - not because of the undercooked potatoes.....  because of the server.  

We are not sure why she had such disdain for us - but we got the feeling we were not the clientele she deems appropriate for the restaurant.  Granted our tattoos were not showing and we were dressed in our work clothes.... that is still not any excuse for the air of superiority and very, very poor service.

Our sever Tiffani came to the table within the first minute we were sat. She was very attentive but not overbearing at all. When ever we needed something she was always within eyes reach and was quick to make sure everything met to our needs and satisfaction. There were also managers walking around checking on all tables which I thought was really comforting, not only for the customers but their employees as well.
I ordered the vegan mushroom tacos and a strawberry margarita!!!! The tacos were full of flavor.... I will defiantly be back for more. The strawberry margarita was phenomenal..... with the perfect amount of booze :) Tiffani recommended all the dishes and drinks we ordered and I was very impressed by how much my palette was similar to hers. I was able to degust every bit of my food and drinks without feeling rushed or bothered.

When they get super busy it can be a little slower but nothing major and frankly no restaurant is perfect.  Since the other places have opened in the strip mall the whole area has really picked up, which is nice to see.  The Cali Benedict, shrimp and chorizo hash, and the Florentine are excellent.

The second to last order they forgot 4 orders of refried beans.  At $2.95 per order of beans, that's like $12 of food we didn't receive.  We talked to someone at the restaurant and they promised to make it up to us on our next order.  So that day is today and low and behold, we go to pick up our order and while checking the order in the car before pulling away, they have forgotten an order of tortillas!!  It's a good thing we had not left yet and have learned our lesson about checking our order.  A word to the wise, check your order for accuracy before leaving the establishment!!

The chips were okay, kind of thin and tasted like some cheap supermarket chips. The salsa and beans were alright, not special but not bad at all. The non-custom standard guacamole was really good, but that was about the only thing I had that could be called really good. 

My main meal was the flautas combination plate with grilled veggies. The veggies included broccoli which was absolutely ruined. It was grilled fast on high heat, which ended up just burning and charring the florets, and that's a very bad flavor to add to broccoli. The flautas themselves were okay, not special, I just kind of ate them until I was tired of them and didn't take home any leftovers. I feel like that's almost worse than giving me bad food. At least make me have an opinion about it, right? The shell was also cooked a bit too much, so was hard to cut through.

The wife was also unhappy with her meal, I forget what exactly she got but the tortilla it was wrapped in was super soggy on the bottom and not all that pleasant to eat. 

The staff, however, was great. They were very attentive and treated us great. I'll definitely give this place a second chance for sure, if for no other reason than to try their custom guacamole option made table-side.

Once you exit Chester Station and look towards the main street (Danforth) you should see it.  Literally a 30 second walk.
There is PAID Green P parking beside Chester Station.  $6 full day or $1 every half hour (bring coins or it takes credit card).

Facility: Spacious show room(s)! When we arrived, we thought that there was only one room, when in fact, there are at least two more.  I was disappointed to find this out over halfway through the appointment though.  I would have like to explore more.  I did see at least two sitting rooms where the bride could come out to the three-way mirror.

Service: We arrived on time was right away, were were greeted.  I was asked about my budget, my wedding the styles I liked right off the bat. Consultant, Linda, was very attentive. I wished she took the time to get to know me a little more but it WAS a Saturday and there were other brides.  She did make me feel like I was her only bride though which was great. I NEVER felt rushed.  In fact, on a Saturday, we were going over our 1.5 hours and I felt bad so I constantly said ""After this one, we can wrap it up."" But Linda was great and pulled a few more dresses (more in tune with my tastes). I loved that I could take my time and that the consultants didn't ""vulture"" over us.

Dresses: Sample dresses are not in the best condition (some are ripped, torn etc), BUT it's the design were are looking at.  The selection was GREAT, and I was so disappointed that I didn't have enough time to look through them all.  I will be returning.

Price: I gave them my price point and my consultant pulled only dresses within my budget.  It was great because it was one less thing I had to worry about so I could really just focus on the dress. They offer discounts for off-site alterations and gave us some ""tokens"" for discounted lunch and coffee in the area. Many dresses I saw were between $1000 - $2000.

Fitting Room: Quite small.  I really wished they were bigger.  With some of the more flowy dresses, I felt like I was swimming in the fitting room. There was only enough room for myself and one BM to help me into my dress. 

Photos: Not allowed.  My MOH was unable to attend but I was allowed to take photos of the highest dress contender. I was very happy they were able to accommodate my request which in the end, helped me to decide that I WILL be purchasing a dress from Becker's, just have to find the ONE.

Overall: Service was okay, I had hoped the consultant(s) would have gotten to know me a little better and pick up on my tastes a little more quickly.  It's a good thing that I am a quick and decisive bride. I was disappointed in some of the damage on the sample dresses but I LOVED the variety and the prices of their dress selections.  In the end, what made this a great experience was the selection, the price and the no pressure atmosphere (something rare on a Saturday).  I will be returning to Beckers and I DO recommend them!



Second visit:

On my second visit, I was pretty sure I would be committing to a dress that day.  I went on a Saturday and IT. WAS. PACKED.  However, I think the consultants knew that I would be buying so our party ending up in the one private suite instead of a fitting room. This time, we got Kathy.  She NAILED my taste and the FIRST dress she brought in was the One. Kathy really seemed to know her stuff! I felt that my second appointment went much better than the first.  Though I went over the time slot, Kathy accommodated me and my party for however long I needed.



Phone service: Spoke with Liat.  She was very sweet and understanding.  No complaints!!



Third visit:

This visit was to confirm and order the dress.  I asked Amanda at the front if I could have a button down back rather than the zipper and she said yes that it could be ordered with that change.  I later mentioned it to Kathy who said told me no, that the dresses come as is, but once I told her that Amanda said yes, she checked and it was a go.  Service was always great and once you have committed to buy the dress, they will allow you to take photos.

-------------------------------------------

Brides notes:
- when you are allowed,  TAKE LOTS OF PHOTOS!!  You won't see your dress for months, you definitely want something to look forward to when you get home.

- the dress I chose was an in-house designer, Jayne Lewis.  Another reason you will want to take boatloads of photos is because this ""designer"" does not have stock images.  Actually there really is no information online about Jayne Lewis/Jayne Louis.  I am convinced that these dresses are out-sourced to China.  However, I LOVE my dress and I am okay with it.

- it will get HOT, even in November/December.  Wear deodorant!!

- look at yourself OFF the pedestal

- look at the BACK of your dress as you walk away to see if you like it

- if I went back, I'd ask for Kathy right off the bat~",2,LTnCcTKbS-SBQlFGJ5Jm7g

I had the ribeye steak cooked medium which when it arrived it was cooked medium.  It came with grilled corn on the cob and sweet potato fries which were very good.

The decor is like a sports type bar and there were a lot of empty tables to sit down. There was really bad cheesy music playing which was rather annoying.
I ordered the Mariner Eggs Benedict which came with a choice of bagel or English muffin. I decided on the the whole wheat bagel. My companion had the reuben sandwich. The food arrived promptly and was luke warm. I found the portion size adequate but the bagel was dry and tasted a bit stale. The rest of the meal was adequate.  My companion remarked on the meat in the reuben sandwich saying it was pretty good but the sandwich needed sauce. He really likes his reuben sandwiches so I guess this was adequate for him. 
The server was quick and efficient and with 2 x fruit juices, the bill came to $40. We both felt this was too expensive for the quality of the food but that's what you get eating out in the theater district.

Decor is cute with a cat theme, menu is pretty large, and the sizes are good for the price.

The menu is so varied that if you want something healthy and light from a delicious Turkey Spinach Panini to their fabulous Homemade Meatloaf, to an incredible Vegetarian Entree, the chef has cast his magic culinary skills just for you!

The quality of the food is superior and the compilation of just the right ingredients seals the deal.  The chef has created sublime sauces and outstanding ""Au jus"" which is the backbone of any outstanding cuisine.  

The beer list is extensive with brews that are off the charts.  We all tried different beers and thoroughly enjoyed them.  The bar is hip happening and a great place to hang out with your friends.

I reckoned it was time to get tougher so I thought about my rating for B&B for ages, wondering if there was a way to subtract stars.  I just couldn't do it!  I really liked this place.

The store/café itself is gorgeous.  It's bright and white with pretty tables and chairs and a cosy couch over by one window.  There are cute touches like chandeliers and big glass containers full of meringues as decoration.  Examples of fantastically decorated occasion cakes are along one wall.  I actually think I might like to live there.

The biggest challenge was choosing what to eat.  Everything looked divine.   They had a selection of cupcakes, a big carrot cake, quiche, butter tarts, macarons and many more things I can't remember.  I was too overwhelmed by greed.  I eventually settled on a red velvet cupcake-it's a good test of a cupcakery I think-and we decided to share some macarons.  Service was extremely friendly and we settled down to our sugar fest.

I loved my red velvet cupcake.  It was light and tasty with a light cream cheese frosting.  I had to restrain myself from gobbling it down.   Yum!  I tried some of the carrot cake which was delicious.   The cream cheese was feather light and incredibly creamy and the cake was spicy and flavourful.  I thought I might have to sit on my hands to stop myself from digging in and stealing it all.  Macarons were also delicious.  Sweet and chewy with recognisable flavours.  We tried hazelnut and chocolate, chocolate, vanilla and salted caramel.  The salted caramel was subtle but very tasty.  I think chocolate might have been my favourite-as usual!

If I had to nitpick, I might say that I'd have liked my coffee in a real mug instead of a paper cup and real forks instead of plastic.  It was good coffee though and crockery and cutlery are not enough to mark it down for.  It was a really cosy place to sit and I could imagine happy times sitting there with a book or just watching the world go by.  The atmosphere was so nice that we didn't notice the time go by and overstayed our welcome to past 6pm.  The girl who had served us was very sweet though and just smiled and wished us a great weekend as we left too late.  Sweet people and sweet cakes-how could I not love it?",3,eqWEgMH-DCP74i82BEAZzw

VxCnyVYn-FFgv6F1EqbdKA,1,2007-12-12 17:37:45,0,QJmlOpjwwDO9pmmDZQRWdg,"This is a review of the Gold Coast's coffee shop steak special.  You see it touted on some websites as one of the best in Las Vegas deals.  I think it is a decent belly stuffer but not a great deal for most people.  It is probably very popular because they keep A-1 steak sauce on the table unlike most places where you have to ask for it.

This is the $10.95 16 oz. T-bone.  The salad is decent size and they put a lot of blue cheese dressing on the salad which included olives, a few slices of cucumbers and tomato.  The quality of the blue cheese dressing was pretty good with visible chunks of blue cheese.

The steak was accompanied by 3 potato halves, 2 onion rings, 1 halved Texas Toast, a miller or bud (I forgot which one) baked beans and a lettuce garnish.

Baked beans were okay--probably Heinz out of a can.  The 2 onion rings were more like garnish than a true side but actually pretty good-- one of the better onion rings.  The potatoes tasted like they were lightly fried with a crispy top but they could have been baked.  There was a slight fishy flavor but under the crust they tasted okay.

The big disappointment was the steak. It is fairly thin, about 3/8 to 1/2 inch thick which means that it is difficult to get a medium rare type of consistency through it all.  Also, it had a fair amount of gristle.  

I remember the last time I ate there I was pleasantly surprised by the value for the meal.  However, I've read that because steak prices have been going up that places are substituting Choice for Prime and even Select for Choice.  I think that Gold Coast may have done that here.

You still get enough to eat because the toast is thick, the salad large and you have baked beans but they are all fillers.  The star of a steak dinner is the steak and I think it is worse than I remember.  If you want to fill up this is still a great deal.  If you have eaten here before when it was better, you may want to reconsider.",1,DBzVCu2k2z-l5nl0rbVqmg

unfortunately...things didn't pan out so well.  I've been to the Hard Rock and like the vibe of the casino floor, the music, the memorabilia, and the decided to try the hotel and its amenities.  
the first thing that didn't go as planned was the fact that we couldn't get the King Size bed we reserved for the first night and so they put us in the double Queen.  I couldn't sleep the first night at all!  the beds felt like college futons - small, too soft, and uncomfortable!  I pushed with the front desk and was able to switch which isn't great mid stay.  But the King was way better!
The hotel and casino is huge! we must have walked over 10k steps each day just trying to get around to eat, casino, and pools.  Also, the layout was so disorienting we got lost a couple of times.  Didn't help when we drank - LOL.  
the food and drinks were pretty on the high side and it was unfortunate that some drink and food coupons were not given until the 2nd day there...why? i have no idea.
The pools were pretty nice...very loungey and helped to cool off the 100degree weather we got in August.  
Overall...it was ok.  I always do enjoy the music they play all over the hotel and the music videos constantly playing as well.  Its a younger vibe which is why I like it better than the senior  casino/hotels on the strip.  I hope the Hotel can update some problems since I'd like to go again if its a better trip without so many speed bumps...",0,LkAR6OW-luN8MzTK55sAyg

We go to three different locations but the Trop/Pecos is our regular one. Seems like the inventory varies. It's funny, because you'd think it's the same company, right? Also, setup of the store also varies, too, as well. 

This warehouse store (chain) has the best prices on: mostly baby items such as diapers, wipes, aveeno, 2 pack Apple Juice (100% juice), cases of bottled water, chips, baking supplies, cheese, bread, bagged salads, birthday cakes, and floss. Sometimes, veggies, and meat prices are good, too. Samples of food is available on the weekends. Also, there are weekly sample promotions (you scan your card into the self-service machine). And then when you're done at checkout, make sure to stop at the cafe for cheap deals, like the frozen yogurt (triple berry- my favorite!) and sodas.

We had to stop at the customer service line once, and that was a super long time, but since there was only one cashier to help, what do you expect?

On 9/18/2016, I visited the CVS Pharmacy located at 8116 S. Las Vegas Blvd., Las Vegas, Nevada to use my 30% and 20% coupons.

Unfortunately the 30% and 20% coupons were not applied to the cologne I purchased. According to your Store Manager, Azucena (Suzy) the cologne was a buy one get one 50% off and the coupon doesn't apply to sale items. I advised the store manager, Azucena the product was not marked as a sale item and she rudely replied we're not expected to label every product that's on sale. Really, I'm a business owner myself and I expect my employees to do their job, it's disturbing a corporation as large as CVS wouldn't require the same from its staff, especially a member of their management team. Furthermore, if the proper sale signage was posted, they only had one in stock so they would be unable to honor the sale.

To add insult to injury when I requested the phone number from Azucena she threw the pin on the counter. Of course, I brought this to her attention and was abruptly dismissed. I have been a frequent customer at CVS Pharmacy's across the United States and have never been treated with such disrespect and disdain.

CVS Pharmacy should honor the coupons they send to their customers if the items are not marked properly by staff. Additionally, I suspect discrimination is a factor in this case.

The moment you combine sushi and thai in one place, you know neither will be the best ever. The place is small and unassuming, rarely full (I was there on a Saturday night and barely half the place was full - and got even emptier around like 9PM) and does not try to over impress with anything.
From my perspective, the place is nicely decorated, clean and has a nice vibe to it. Tables are pretty close together but the emptiness allows you a lot of privacy. Not a bad place for a date :)
Service is a bit slower than expected as only one waitress works there. Not the best thing, but when the place is so empty you really don't need more. We got served and used the waiting time as a nice moment to chit chat with my girlfriend. 
The sushi mix plate was quite nice - not mind blowing, but did the trick (I will admit I am not a sushi fan). I had the yellow thai curry and my gf had the vegetarian pad thai. Both really good (my yellow thai curry with the coconut rice was a great experience and enjoyed every bite of it). Did any of them beat the quality of a top sushi or thai restaurant? No... but then again, enjoyed fully in a nice clean place and the experience was really nice... just like the price. Very decent prices overall.
Take the place for what it is and enjoy it... not a great place but you will not be disappointed.",0,C97XNBgGjiSUChUSPloYlQ

It was pretty disappointing to drive all the way here and for it to not feel like a vegetarian/vegan dining experience. 
The food itself was mediocre. There were a lot of options to choose from, and we decided on the spicy basil noodles and eggplant stew. The noodles were alright - good amount of vegetables, not a ton of flavor. The eggplant stew was incredibly salty. The eggplant was soaked in a thick brown sauce and almost inedible without tons of water to wash it down. Overall a pretty disappointing experience :(",0,z6tKNN05UDjuWNMqrdNbNg

No, it's not A-OK! It's not all bad either.

Seeing the confusing  American Chinese / pseudo Japanese/ Thai lite menu I didn't want to commit and instead chose two appetizers : ""Crispy golden calamari served with our own spicy dynamite dipping sauce"" and I think Thai shrimp in sweet chili sauce - extra hot for me please. 

The weather at sunset was just perfect, I sat outside and chilled with a generous cup off Ecco Domani Pinot Grigio ($5) . If it wasn't for that I probably would have been pissed off with the food. 

The calamare itself wasn't bad. It wasn't crispy but it wasn't tough either and mercifully it wasn't buried deep in fried breading like so many places. Plus it came with a bit of marinated ginger, nothing Korean mind you, but still, nice. BAD, the so called ""spicy dynamite dipping sauce"" was a joke, a bad joke! Absolutely bland and tasteless (what was it mayo and paprika?) so mild you could feed it to a baby. 

I mentioned this to two of the kids working there but they looked lost, one even said that people don't order their Calamare spicy , I had to tell him spicy what the menu claims. Screw it! I ate the calamare without any sauce,picked on the ginger and washed it down with the wine. 

The proper description for the shrimp sauce should have been ""really, really sweet chili sauce""  My tastebuds were drowning in High Fructose sweetener,  good thing I had ordered extra hot it compensated, a little. The shrimp itself was passable and there were some bits of fresh veggies under all that so it didn't feel totally like junk food. No totally anyway.

So there you have it, passable shopping mall food and a big cup of Grigio.",1,ZvmC522FAwxt8qT1jxqliw

The only complaint I could make is concerning the service. The people are friendly and helpful, but there seems to be a lack of coordination and structure. My food was ready and waiting for me the last time I picked up takeout (today), but I still spent more than 5-7 minutes inside the restaurant as the first person in line at the counter. That aside, it's really nice that they bring the food around to the outside of the counter, rather than handing it to you from behind it.

The prices for the pedicures were either $25 for a basic, or $45 for everything else. To me that was kind of high. I usually go to a salon in North Las Vegas that charges $25-35 for the exact same pedicures using the same exact spa products. My pedicure came out nice and the lady doing it really took her time. The massages were a little too gentle where it felt like she was just rubbing her hand over my leg. But I appreciated that she really took her time and did a nice job on my toes. 
While getting my pedicure, another lady was working on my manicure. They didn't have white chrome gel which is what I wanted. So they did their best to accommodate it to something similar. The gel I got is white glitter, not really a polish. She had to put it on with a brush. I didn't really like the texture of my nails because it was painted on so uneven. The color itself looks nice and I liked that she really tried to mix colors and glitter to get me the color I want.
Im not sure how I feel about the service. I felt like any time I voiced a concerned really nicely, they would snap back and be really rude. I don't think the prices are worth the service and quality I paid for. I really enjoy my cheaper nail salon in North Las Vegas better. They have better service and prices and the techs are just super nice and welcoming.

I came to try their Cuban sandwich, and lo and behold, it was the special of the day. 

It took about fifteen minutes for my food to arrive, and I was getting a little antsy. The food was worth the wait though.

The Cuban sandwich that I had today was pretty good, but not as good as the one that I ate at the original Versailles restaurant on Calle Ocho in Miami. The sandwich wasn't pressed, which is typical in a Cuban sandwich, and the roast pork was dry and without much flavor. Without melting the cheese, the only liquid in the sandwich is mustard, and this just doesn't make the sandwich moist enough. It also leaves the bread cold, which is incongruous with the sandwich itself. 

The ""maduros,"" their fried sweet plantains, were good. 

Service from Oliva, my waitress, was fantastic. I overheard her make several excellent recommendations to other diners. She kept my beverage refilled without being asked. When I complemented her on her great service, she said that today was the fourth day by herself on the job. 

I LOVE the décor of the restaurant. The light green paint of the interior has a beautiful swirl pattern ingrained into the walls. The artwork is tasteful and well chosen. The feeling of the restaurant is light and airy, and truly reminiscent of restaurants in Miami. The only thing missing are palm trees in the courtyard. 

There is plenty of free, two hour, parking along the street. If there is none in front of the restaurant, just circle the block - you'll find a parking spot nearby.

I ordered a tres leches cake to sample at home, but I haven't gotten around to trying it yet. 

***UPDATE*** I ate the tres leches cake Saturday night, and it was FAN-tastic. 

The prices were fairly reasonable, but by the time that I added the maduros, a soda, and the tres leches for dessert, my tab was $13+. Add in a generous tip, and one is pushing a $20 bill. 

I'm deducting a star for for the ""dry-ish"" Cuban sandwich. The prices were reasonable, but the wait for food was too long. It only takes a minute to make a sandwich and cut it in half. The plantains came out before the sandwich! Go figure...

Scallop sashimi - off the daily menu. Super duper fresh, came with wasabi and soy sauce.
Baked brie - crispy and melty brie. Was a lot less interesting after it cooled down, though...so eat quickly.

I was bummed with the serving size (for $11 with tax), but that is OK, I was most disappointed with was the taste. Maybe it was a fluke, or maybe something I did not agree with, it was oily and a bit too salty. The desert was a savior. Even though I can buy mochi balls for half the price and in more quantity elsewhere, I was glad they served it at their location. Convenience anyone?

Their menu is fairy simple, they have a lot of tapas items on the menu. The cocktail list is extensive. The food was a fusion of Asian and American. We ordered the popcorn shrimp and beef tartar to start. I enjoyed the beef tatare. It came with a raw egg, which added a creaminess to the beef. They had a neat twist and served it with Chinese shrimp crackers. The was pretty spicy from the wasabi, which was a tad strong if you eat the tartare on its own. It definitely needed the shrimp cracker. Tried the shrimp popcorn. Wasn't really a fan. I didn't enjoy the popcorn batter, I thought it over powered the taste of the shrimp. Although, the shrimp was cooked perfectly. 

We also ordered the lettuce meal to share. This reminds me a bit of the Korean bossam meals. Definitely enough for 2 people. This was my favourite dish of the night. The pork was melt in your mouth soft. The beef was the star of the night. It was tender and flavourful. The au jus sauce was yummy and had a great depth of flavour. The meat was accompanied by lettuce, sticky rice, kimichi, pickled veg, and saracha sauce, and mayo. If you do go here the lettuce meal is a definite must try.

The salad was plain and largely shredded carrots but achieved it's purpose...and I agree with the other commenter that they don't do anything for presentation of the food.  The cornbread was okay...I didn't eat the second piece.  The West African lentil soup with sweet potato was delicious.  I would get that again.  And the juice/smoothie menu looks amazing.

After I told her she asked me if I spoke with her or her mother on the phone which I replied that I wasn't sure and she made a joke about Asian accents while the other customer and I just stood there. She said she can get away with it because she's Asian and white people like us can't because it's considered racist.

Personally, I used Orbitz and booked a flight/hotel combination and  received a King room for something like $60 per night with all the discounts, etc.  This place is worth $60 per night, though, I probably would not pay more than $80 per night.

Downtown Cleveland is a ghost town and this really hurts the hotels in the neighborhood.  If you like theater, this hotel is located adjacent to Playhouse Square so it's very convenient in that aspect.

Some things I liked...

The super cheapo rate I received when I booked this hotel.  There's nothing like a HUGE bargain when traveling.

The chef's signature pasta.  Shrimp Fettuccine Alfredo.  Delicious.  The dinner rolls were hot and fresh and the Mixed Greens salad was to die for.

The comfy king bed was great.  The rooms could use some updating as far as electronics are concerned though.

Some things I disliked...

My breakfast was late.

I was told to set my room-service tray outside my door when I was finished eating.  It sat there for more than 24 hours, even after housekeeping serviced all the rooms on the floor.

The added gratuity on room service is 19% which is more than  sufficient and means that I shouldn't feel guilty for not leaving an EXTRA tip.  But, for some reason, I always did.

For the second half of my stay, my whole floor smelled of sewage.  Dirty, rotten, feces.  Something was backed up somewhere and the smell was even more putrid in the bathroom.  I had to keep the door closed.  Also, There was a loud banging noise above my room.  Not man-made but something in the building itself--pipes or foundation maybe.

The mark down is for the roaming photographer who's running some sort of ""you're on the rollercoaster at DisneyWorld and want to buy pictures.""

The process to actually get seated is insane. It's kinda like a Disney FastPass. We went in a group of 3 on a Wednesday at 3:30 expecting no line. We were wrong. First you sign in on the electronic kiosk and they'll give you a time to go back. When you get the text to go back (for us 45 min), then you get in line to pay at the cash register. It took us about 20 min to reach the cash register to hand over a huge chunk of moolah. Then you line up again at the front of the restaurant to get a table. That's really when the fun begins. We were inching along for 40 more minutes. The whole process is crazy, but I just thought that the wait was making me hungrier and hungrier, which is a good thing!

The food itself is amazing. It better be, if each person is shelling out $60! The seafood was superb. The carving station perfect. There is several international stations: Latino food, Asian food, American comfort food. There is a cook to order Asian noodle soup station. Standard salad station, meat and cheese station. 

My favorites, there were a lot of things I liked: Wagyu beef from the carving station, cocktail shrimp (plump and sweet), citrus salmon, CRAB AVOCADO TOAST (best thing I ever had at a buffet), coppa (cured meat), mussels in matcha broth, grilled corn, and quail over polenta.

BYYTKKHMGoTPjILP-WMpFw,0,2013-05-15 02:53:02,0,_e6FUNzXWDUfr4vbnilR-A,"Unfortunately this is not my first time here.  On previous times I've been here the experience has been more than sub-par... but today I couldn't figure out what to eat so I landed here.  Figured there's a banner outside that said under new management so I'd give 'em yet another try.
    On first glance the joint looks glammed up a bit more than on previous trips here.  You know a lil extra decor here, a lil decor there... I end up making my way to an available table, got my drink order in then made my way to the buffet line.  At that exact point I realize my mistake of giving this place another shot.
    I opted for the broccoli beef, bbq pork, general Tsao chicken and some vegetable fried rice.  All except the rice looked fairly unpleasing (like they been left in the tray too long and yet those were their best options).  Got back to my table and dug into the pork and found it was so overdone, it was dry and hard.  The beef was so rubbery, the broccoli way overcooked and dark.  And the rice although good looking was so hard and undercooked that I almost broke teeth and lost a few fillings.  Left that after a few bites, then noticed I'd get some shrimp they had just taken out and figured I'd take advantage of something fresh.  Fresh it was and salty as heck too, making me sip my Pepsi away in two gulps to counter the Salton Sea I had just ingested.
    In all this not a good place to eat.  I've been here 3 times.  As the old saying goes, ""3 strikes and you're out.""  Yes it's under new management, but it must be the same crummy cooks and perhaps the same motto applies to this management of leaving old food in the tray and making it look so unappetizing that they don't care.

When she said it was market price and $48, I think we really didn't hear that part.   Expecting an enormous slab of meat with lots of potatoes and veggies, we were surprised to get an average size of meat and two small discs of potato along with 8 asparagus sprigs.   Granted it tasted good, but not $48 good.   No salad or soup offered as part of the meal or even bread.  To top it off, our friends ordered Shepard Pie and it was so small we thought it was out mashed potatoes!   They said it was extremely tasteless and were extremely disappointed.

Long story short, I have bad credit that I have been working on repairing for the past several years. I understand that with bad credit, it's hard to get much of anything... So now that my current car that I have purchased several years ago (and PAID OFF) had an A/C that wasn't repairable for the 2nd summer living in Phoenix, I decided it was time for a new car. 

I saved up well over $1,000.00, knowing I have bad credit and would need something to negotiate from a buy here pay here place. I found the Simple Car store from an ad they posted in Craigslist, and it appealed to me because they were close to my work and reported positive to credit card companies (apparently).

Last Thursday, July 30th, I went in, and was told I was ""Preapproved"" and could test drive any car in the lot. I was told with my amount down and what I was looking for (type of cars, payments, etc) that it would be ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEM getting me a car, even today if I wanted.

I test drove two vehicles, one 2007 Pontiac G6 with 108k miles on it and also test drove a 2006(if I remember the year) Chevy Cobalt ..... The cobalt was in terrible shape, I can't believe they didn't clean up the interior better honestly. I told the girls after test driving both and looking at the other cars they had on the lot that the G6 would be the only one I was interested in honestly.

I was asked to talk with Alex, whom I was told was the sales manager. She did the paperwork, I gave her all of the personal information she asked me for and said I was APPROVED. I quickly called my boyfriend to come look at the vehicle and bring down a small amount of cash so we could put a hold on the car.... at this point it was too late in the evening to coordinate insurance, so I wanted to complete the sale the next day. I was asked to put $100 down on the car and she would have everything ready for me the next day. I was even given copies of the car info, the carfax, and the loan details that I was ""approved"" for from their financing since I had to do in-house financing with my credit. 

The next day at work there was so much back and forth details it was RIDICULOUS. I put the insurance on the car, only to have Alex text me in the middle of my work day to explain her OWNER declined my loan because of my work history (I just started a new job) and that I needed a cosigner? I ended up leaving work early just so I could go down and see just exactly what was going on..... THIS WAS RAISING A TON OF RED FLAGS FOR ME.

Let me point out also that their ads say all you need is $500 down. Alex tried saying I wanted the most expensive car on the lot so she would have to put me in something cheaper (aka the piece of crap filthy cobalt or something similar on their minimal lot)..... Not to mention the Kelly Blue Book price of the Pontiac G6 was $2,000.00 lower then what they were asking for, even at other dealerships in town and even at other buy-here-pay-here dealerships.

After we got back into this dealership, she said I would need to provide more money down to even get considered. I told her we could do this... We re-negotiated this Loan that I was already supposedly ""Approved"" for ((this is called a yo-yo scam people, look it up)).... After making us wait for an hour, she came back to tell me that once again I was denied the options I was trying to offer to work with THEM.... I thought dealerships were supposed to work with YOU??? I asked she refund the HOLDING FEE that I put down of $100 back on to our credit card and we walked out.....

THIS IS THE REASON I DECIDED TO PUT A BAD REVIEW TO THIS COMPANY ALSO:

Guys, I went to Cactus Jack's Auto, because they posted an ad on Craigslist for the same car: a 2007 Pontiac G6.... The one I ended up purchasing from Cactus Jacks the VERY NEXT DAY had over 20,000 less miles, and was actually $1,500.00 CHEAPER... The loan process took me literally 1 hour, I was approved and driving my new (better) car home. I ended up putting less money down and my payment/loan amount was for half of the time/durration then the one offered to me at ""SIMPLE-RIP-OFF-BULLCRAP-Car-STORE""...

I know its hard if you have bad credit or are trying to fix your old bad credit. Don't feel like you aren't worth it to still shop around and find a better place. They are out there, and this dealership IS NOT ONE OF THEM.....",7,pmo4cKMNtORU-aLWPz4ccg

There is no dance floor but you can squeeze in front of the tables and the band if you don't mind dancing on tile. Uncorked was a good dance band but nobody was dancing -- hmmm. Maybe it was the lousy accommodations for dancers or maybe most of the time their bands aren't good enough to dance to.

The draft beer selection had many craft IPAs. It would have been nice to have more variety but I'm being picky because most sports bars have far worse selections. I like that they have several sizes -- my favorite was 22 ounces.

Our server was already waiting at our table and we noticed that nothing had been done to them to accommodate our big group.

I tell him no that we would like to sit together. He says ""okay"" and so we actually help him move the tables together.. He takes our drink orders and and brings them out right away. 

We tell him we are ready to order and so he writes the orders all down..

Salmon with a loaded potato soup and green beans

Grilled chicken breast w a potato soup and mashed potatoes 

Two orders of Tri tip steak with loaded baked potatos and french fries

Two orders of pork chops with broccoli and green beans

Two orders of a rib eye steak (one with rice and potatoes and the other was a salad and baked potato)

Kids cheeseburger sliders. Kids meal comes with a scoop of ice cream!

Our server was very friendly and attentive throughout! For being a big group, he made sure to always keep our drinks refilled and made sure we were doing okay. 

My sister n law actually found a long piece of hair deep into her salad. She told the server right away and he kindly brought us out a new one. Other then finding that long hair, the food was great.

If you list the ingredients on the menu then it should be in the dish. I also had to wait 24 minutes to get my beef salad. It took over 40 minutes to get my final 2 dishes, drunken chicken and larb. We had asked for medium spice for both dishes but instead got mild. My girlfriend said that she enjoyed the flavors of the dish. I agree, the dishes are good but one dimensional in flavor. 

Thai food is built in layers. You add spices, chili, savory meats, and layer additional flavors by adding crushed peanuts, bean sprouts, cilantro, and mints. Eating each dish was like getting a good hamburger, bun, and cheese but leaving out the onions, lettuce, tomato, pickles, mayo, mustard, and relish. 

Considering the options in the Las Vegas area, I would recommend that you give this place a try.  It's worth a visit but don't expect to be blown away by authentic Thai flavors.

The manager and all the employees have always been very  helpful and friendly to me.  Their prices are fair. There are a couple of store policy changes that I wish would change.  If they don't have the item in the store the only way they will order it in would be if you physically come into the store to have them order it.  They will not permit a request over the phone, it would make it easier for me if I could order the item over the  phone.  In addition when you request an item to be ordered in I would be nice to be able to pay for it at that time and be able to pick it up at your convenience.  Under the store's current policy you can't pay for the item until it arrives at the store, and once it comes in they will only hold it 14 days.  I have also done business with BUYBacks. BuyBacks policy also requires you to be in the store in order to order an item.  However they require you to pay for the item at the time of order.  You can have the item shipped either to the store or a place of your choosing.  If you have it shipped to the store they will hold it until you come to pick it up since you have already paid for it.  I like both stores, however over the past year I am tending to favor The Exchange.

At first, I couldn't tell if anyone was there to take my order (there was a woman seated with her family and at first I thought, maybe she was the owner or other staff member, turns out no).  A man appeared from behind the cash counter (was working on stuff on the back I guess) and took my order.  I asked about sizing and if I could buy two flavours in one cup.  He said normally they don't allow it but granted me my request.  I ordered Mango and Stracciatella and they were both so good!  I actually wanted the small size but he gave me the kiddie size (which is even smaller than ""Small"" - I should have been more clear). 

I think I enjoyed the Stracciatella a bit more than the Mango (thought it'd be the reverse).  Admittedly, I'm not that experienced with gelato but I found this to be very good (definitely not ice cream).  I've visited another place selling ""gelato"" and it was really ice cream - super disappointing but not this place!  Heads up: This place is not good for groups (very small inside), also for some reason, it was *very* warm inside.  I'm not sure if this high temp is the norm but it makes for some uncomfortable queuing and probably dining in.  Also, they take debit (probably credit also) which is great for convenience reasons.  For the kiddie size, it came to $4.46 (I think it's $3.95 plus tax).  Again, I'm not well-versed with gelato especially in this city so I don't know if this was a good price although because it was so good, I wish I had the bigger size.

Hostess seated us RIGHT in front of the performer when there were at least 10 other empty tables that I saw as we walked in - no way they were all resos. So noisy. 

Seemed like they only had one server covering the entire front section and he was taking forever so I snagged what I would guess was the bar manager and ordered through him. 

Food and drinks came out somewhat slowly... Ordered chicken parm sandwich which was good but the piece of chicken was about four inches wide and the bread was a ciabatta or something - only an inch and a half so there wasn't even nearly enough bread for this sandwich = very meet and awkward to eat. Delicious otherwise. Fries were extremely bland, took one bite and didn't bother with them afterward.

We had good seats and enjoyed a pretty perfect center orchestra view.  But this show is very low octane and low impact.  It would be vastly improved if there was choreography of interest to punctuate the slower parts of the show.

If you have seen a three minute clip of the Jabbawockeez dance, then you have seen everything there is to see in this show. For me, it dragged in several sections and was quite repetitive.  

I would have liked to see the variety displayed during their days of competition on ABDC.  Some different beats.  Some cool feats.  Unfortunately, this show is just a recycling of standard choreography seen throughout film and television today.  Nothing novel or inventive, which is what I admired most about the Jabbawockeez.  Sure, they can spin on their heads for a long time, and windmill like nobody's business, but any Jabbawockeez fan has seen this already.  And the music is essentially the same beat throughout with no experimentation into off-beats or slow tempos.  I must be the only one who goes crazy after listening to the same mix for over an hour!

Back on ABDC, the Jabbawockeez could weave a story in under five minutes.  Here, where they have over an hour to play with, the audience gets no story at all.  Just a jumbled mix of standard dance moves set against a pretty sparse, black-lit backdrop.  Even a bunch of mini stories could have worked.  But nope, you don't get that either.

For me, I appreciate music and dance that do more than just sound or look good.  I like there to be a depth in the things I give my attention to.  Art forms should strive to be multifaceted.  Unfortunately, I've discovered that the Jabbawockeez have a long way to go towards being true artists, and this show is as flat and monotone a performance as you can get in Vegas.",7,6K7j8OiLChFflIrh95Pn4A

We went in for dinner on a Friday night. Somewhat of a line but the tables seemed to empty out fast and the staff was quick to clean and ready the table for the next customers.

Our group ordered family style and it truley was an awesome mix of asian dishes.

Ever since then I think everytime I am in vegas around the Bellagio I have taken a trip to Noodles.

Most recently I got there during lunch and they had multiple dim sum carts with a variety of foods to delight any pallet. 

Dont forget that this place is open till 2AM which makes it a great drunk treat for any vegas night!

I find myself coming back over and over to look at house and kitchen stuff I absolutely don't need. Maybe I need new pillows or thank you notes? No? I still need to come look at them because it's Target. Addicting.

This one is closer to my house and it's a relatively nice size. I wouldn't rave about customer service because it's very, very basic or sometimes doesn't exist. On my last visit I had a young lady ringing me up and talking to her friend on the side at the same time. She couldn't scan some soap so she asked me what the price was and I couldn't remember (but I knew it was on sale for two-something dollars). Instead of checking it out, I watched her enter $3.99 as she continued to speak with her friend. I found some other mistakes as well. When I'm out on the floor browsing, I rarely ever get anyone asking if I need any help (if any associates happen to be nearby). 99% of the time I don't actually need help, but it's the thought that counts I guess.

I don't usually grocery shop at Target, but if I do need something then this one is fine for me. It's a good location, parking is easy, carts are always available (with wipes to sanitize!), there's a starbucks in there (umm hello addiction #1), and you can find some good deals. I like how they have easy to find/browse clearance sections at the end of aisles. If you have their target card then some of the sales give you gift cards for a purchase and you get 5% off all your purchases with that card. I still love you Target.

They rush to take your order the second you are seated, even though you haven't even opened the food or drink menu yet. Once you do place the order, it seems like eternity before your food arrives.  What is even more frustrating, is that we ordered items that were supposed to be easier and quicker to prepare. Not sure what the time frame would have been for items more complicated. 

I understand that game day dining can be hectic and the service is compromised, but an order of nachos shouldn't be swimming in water due to improperly washed and drained lettuce.  I asked for a side of rice and beans, and was told by the server she would see what she could do.

Didn't the hostess ASK. Did she just ASSUME ( we all know the danger of that) it was us? So it was 7 before our order was taken. No refils on drinks, asked for refills, 
only received half. 
Food came out after 60 minutes, except for one pasta, and a steak salad of all things, then the waitress dropped a pizza as she went to take it off the tray, which was on a stand . She could have used the empty end of our tattle and avoided needing to know how to distribute weight evenly. Had to ask for silverware 3 times ( the waitress made a "" joke"" about how "" we don't give silver, you just use your hands"", which could have been funny if she had then brought the silverware without needing to be reminded...again). It took 30 minutes for that .

It took 30 minutes for that pizza to be remade and a simple spaghetti dinner, ( apparently never ordered..and it SHOULD have been a memorable order as the customer had to ask the waitress "" doesn't this dinner come with salad like the others?"" "" you didn't ask what dressing I wanted"")and STILL no refills offered! 
The manager? Came to our table and at first seemed defensive about all the issues but did comp the dropped pizza right off the bat and after a bit of discussion, the pasta dinner that had been forgotten and only arrived after and hour! ( that steak salad? It hadn't been ordered either but the customer cancelled it and just shared one of the pizzas.) Waitress was rolling her eyes when we asked for separate check, (did she think we were on a family outing and grandpa was gonna treat everyone? Of COURSE we needed separate checks) 
From the first moment it was ""I don't know""(then offer to find out and come back with the answer, but no) or "" we're out of that"" ( turns out they weren't , just needed to ask more people) or forgetting to respond to a request...and having to ask someone else...who thought the first person was doing it...result; having to ask twice more for ..everything. 
Now it says this is "" under new management"" so I hope they get the problems worked out soon. I have no doubt the waitress will either get it together or not be there next time. Sure everyone can have a off day, but attitude determines if they will learn and come back improved, or find different work. Her current attitude was to blame everyone else ( I know she has no control over the kitchen, but forgetting to enter orders completely and checking for refills and that requests are being attended to promptly Would go far towards making the wait for food less unpleasant for her customers) Only good thing; food was actually good..nice light sauce on the veal piccata, the pizzas were tasty, everyone liked the warm fresh bread. No complaints on the quality of the food what so ever. 
Final notes: when the manager came to our table to ""apologize"" for being ""understaffed and unusually busy ( to go orders I assume as except for the aforementioned group, ours was the only occupied table) and still training people"", I fully expected he would at LEAST offer free desserts, or a steep discount..but no. I took it upon myself to then talk to him privately and go over my disappointment in everything other than the food..and requested he comp my meal, which he did.

I actually liked the environment because I were seated in the outside patio.  The view was super nice! It's very very pretty at night.  Don't worry about the cold weather because there were heaters outside.  The only sad thing about the night I was there because there was a little rain and it was super windy.  so I guess if you are planning to go, check the weather too!

I ordered the following plates:
1) Pan cake with Foie Gras steak $25 (again, if you know I'm a big fan of foie gras.  I give a-OK to this one.  It's not that I don't know it but it did not have the original taste.  But guess what, the mini pancake tasted really special and i love it!)

2) Escargot - $18 (hmm... i don't recommend this.  sorry)

3) tuna tartare - $18 (no..... don't order this.  it was just plain tuna sashimi (i think it was not marinated) and some cucumber in the bottom..... If you are in the SGV area,  please go to La Grande Orange Cafe in Pasadena for the tuna tartar only $14)

4) Lobster Pasta - $41 (a big disappointment.  I'm sorry to say I didn't like it.  I saw many people recommended this and it's about lobster so I gave a try.  Failed.  It was a big ""plate"" with a little portion of pasta and two pieces of lobster.  The lobster tasted like it's only boiled.  The sauce to the pasta was okay but for $41... I was hoping for more.)

5) Lemonade - $6 (it tastes different and was good.  But $6 I think it was overpriced)

The service was okay, not at my expectation.  The view, again, super nice, despite of the weather.  We took some photos there and the server was nice enough to help us take one photo.  

The total bill came out around $115 which is quite expensive to me.. but the good thing is I have $60 from my mlife credit so I only had the pay the rest.  So don't forget your mlife card.  If you gamble, use it to pay!! heheh 

My tip is make reservation ahead of time.  Go around at 6PM before the peak time.   If you are like me, prefer bigger portion of food... maybe it's not really a good place to try.

I ordered the Arctic Bay Steampot. If you've been to Joe's before you know that these steampots come with your shellfish in net bags. Both of the bags in my pot were opened, I had 1 snow crab leg and 2 shrimp in one bag. The other bag with the lobster was another story. A whole lobster but the only meat in the lobster was in the claws, there was no meat in the rest of the lobster at all, not even the tail. It looked like someone else dug into this pot before I did. I complained to the manager and got a new lobster for my efforts but no crab or shrimp.

My guest ordered the King Crab bucket. Again, it looked like her food was picked over as well. 2 of her crab legs were cracked and had no meat in them. Another complaint to the manager. However with this we received no compensation and just a ""That happens some times"".

We not only love the ambiance but the lunch menu is nice and the portions were large.  I can understand the 2 star review recently for the escargot because, in all honesty, it wasn't classic.  It was more of a deconstructed version and most people aren't into that, I guess.  Anyway, on to the food.

The food was outstanding, from the burger and fries to their sea bass, and up to the souffle.  We had the following:

Course 1 : Escargot - okay, I get it.  Like I said, it's  deconstructed version with lots of thinly sliced garlic pieces, diced tomatoes, wine and cream sauce with a bit of butter.  The flavors were very bold and a bit too much for my taste.  

Course 2: Lobster bisque - this is what a real bisque is.  There's a fine line between chowder and bisque texture, and theirs is smooth, not too creamy and not too watery, and the flavor of lobster is strong.  There's a bit of liquor as well, which was nice, and the drizzle of marscapone with a chunk of lobster meat was wonderful.  I loved every drop.

Main Courses: Their burger with fries was wonderfully juicy, large, and yummy.  The meat was seasoned well, and the aioli was a nice touch.  Fries were crispy and not oily.  The sea bass was beautiful, with a crispy skin, which is what we look for, and perfectly flaky meat.  The bed of veggies was a bonus.

Dessert: Souffle - yum.  Fluffy, creamy, and hot out of the oven.  You can't go wrong with chocolate anything, really.

Price: under 80 dollars.  Fabulous.

Hubby and I go to Vegas quite a bit and we live in Colorado, so we go up to Blackhawk to gamble also.  I guess I was expecting Talking Stick to be more like that.  They don't have craps, which I knew going in, and only a couple 3 Card tables.  I play slots too, so I figured I could keep busy with those.  It was hard to find any machines the place was so crowded.  There were lots of people sitting at the bars not playing the machines, but just hanging out.  The bartenders didn't say anything to them either.  And then to top it off, you still have to pay for drinks even though you are playing the machines.  I was not expecting this.  Usually we get comped drinks while we are playing.  Not here.  

The rooms were nice and there are lots of places to eat and the golf club is fun but also pricey.  Hubby and I may come to hang out if we are visiting Phoenix, but we probably won't stay here again.",5,frWrWdOAdHF3vgeZN4n1kA

500mXn_L5a4MI9GrOXvTeQ,1,2007-08-14 22:31:44,1,3nbC7hqsAU4IND_vQ95H1g,"ICON is the bar inside the Wyndham Hotel, downtown. 

Since this newly renovated bar is walking distance from my home, I was dying for this to be yet another cool place in downtown Phx to hang out. My first impression upon entering the hotel was that my dream had indeed come true. The new lobby of the hotel is, relative to the older version, spectacular, and impressive. As you enter the lobby and first glance at the new bar, with its chic decor and sleek furniture, that impression continues.

But something just doesn't work with this bar as you find a seat and make yourself comfortable. I'm no architect or interior designer by any means and don't pretend I am. But somehow the bar doesn't ""fit"" with the lobby, even though the wall decor, the lounge chairs and sofa, and the backdrop to the bar itself all look very modern and... er...  sexy. (You can see what I'm talking about from the web link above). Maybe it's the fact that there's too much open space. If you're seated at this bar with a friend or date, you feel like you're in the same space as people and employees wandering around the lobby who have nothing to do with the bar. There's no sense of intimacy, with either who you are with or with the rest of the bar. There's too much light, from the lobby of course. 

Plus, when I came here with a friend we ordered drinks and some ""tapas"", which I've come to learn over the years is the American translation for ""tiny portions of food at rip-off prices"", as opposed to what I expect in real tapas in Europe. In fairness, the ""tapas"" here were very good and tasty. But they are in fact very expensive and not at all worth it in my humble opinion. 

It's not that I had a bad experience per se at ICON. I just feel a bit disappointed. The Wyndham is located directly across the street from another 2 or 3-story bar currently being constructed in downtown Phoenix that's expected to be a true destination bar for people from all over the Valley (built by the owner of Scottsdale's AZ 88). A great bar at this location would have transformed this part of Adams Street in a major way. Instead of being great, it's middle of the road though. I'll drop in now and then.

EDIT: After my second visit here in August '07, I have to downgrade to one star. One star for me means: I will never come here again (and I live walking distance from it); and I will never recommend anyone else come here either, except maybe to just walk through the lobby to check out the new look. I came here on a First Friday, when downtown Phoenix is jam-packed to the hilt with visitors, and the ""vibe"" here was absolutely dead. There was no one in the bar other than hotel guests wondering what the fuss was about everywhere other than in ICON. Our waitress was extremely annoying. We stopped here intending to check it out, get one quick over-priced drink, and move on. She was so slow that this process somehow turned into an HOUR. Talk about a buzz-killer. Big mistake stopping here. One I won't make again.",3,mIysRk_cJ5K_BMZ-r06TFw

Overall I do not think there is much value in this restaurant. Burgers are on the expensive starting around $10 and up. Nice decor with some history of the franchise on the walls, apparently a popular chain from California back in the old days but that must've been quite a long time ago. I ordered the mushroom Swiss burger with fries and drink (unlimited refills) and my wife ordered the turkey burger. The mushroom Swiss was moderately sized, nothing crazy about and to be honest I expected more size for the price but the burger was pretty standard similar in taste to Wendy's but much more expensive. My wife's meal was disappointing, the turkey burger patty was very very small and thin almost like a wafer and it was overcooked to a dark brown leaving it very dry and unpleasant. Her burger was 80% bun to be honest. We will not be going back and I don't think it is really worth the value or a try in my opinion.

First off, they changed up their menu. Big time. I remember they had a pretty big food menu with all kinds of bar foods, and it was honestly not bad. Yeah, no more. They whittled that down to a couple pages with not much selection if you don't like plain, unimaginative burgers or sandwiches.

Everything we ordered was way too salty. My fish and chips in particular tasted like I was just stuffing gobs of salt into my mouth. Nasty.

Their cocktails suck balls, which is not that surprising but still shitty. Expect a 90/10 ratio for mixer to liquor if you're lucky. I played it safe and stuck with whatever was on tap. I'll admit that their draft selection was decent. I'm no beer connoisseur though.

Stayed for work and barely slept...walls are paper thin and woke up at every roudy guest in the hall and airplane overhead...and the mattress was very firm.

The tires were rates for 60K miles, but they only had about 10k on them. The new set they put on the rear had 24lbs in them, and they looked fine,  but they should have been at 35lbs. Discount would not stand behind their failed work. 

They are the ones who set those pressures wrong, but I could not prove that fact. They tried to say the chrome on my rims was delaminating inside, and that was causing them to lose pressure. That was total BS, because both front and back tires had matching pressures on either side.  I'll be finding a new tire store next time after this.",4,W0DJOPsSwcAj0uqCJG8iLw

With that being said, i wasn't too thrilled about this dining experience either. The place was dimly lit with no open blinds so it was like walking into a cave that reeked of old cafeteria food. Me and my friend ordered the fried pickles as an appetizer, the pick-2 fajita combo - chicken and steak - ""cadillac style"", and 2 beers. My total bill was over %70. The fried pickles were extremely salty with little to no breading. The fajita toppings arrived 5 mins before the actual entree. The entrees arrive to our table.  I noticed mine had a lot of extra meat. My friend's portion was barely adequate for a small child let alone a grown adult. The steak was very fatty and not ""heated"" properly. The beans were watery and very heavily salted as well. I don't think that each and every menu item has to be ""chipotle"" style, even though yes it is a southwestern restaurant. My only complements on this experience were a) the server was extremely attentive to our needs, even though she was more heavily focused on serving her family at the next table over, and b) the use of self -serve touchscreens at each table, which allowed for drink refill requests, desserts, paying the check, which was cumbersome at best, and game apps for the kids, if you didn't mind shelling out $1.99 for games that come free on most cell phones.

What's wrong with all these yelpers and their taste for Japanese food? Or Am I the weird one here? Honestly....4 stars?

Let me start by saying I did give this place 3 full tries. Each time ordering something new from the menu. Its a very convienent place for me to drop by since its so close by to my neighbourhood. 

Disappointing....

1st time I went here I ordered the usual benchmark Japanese food. Sashimi platter, Kaiso salad and some makimono rolls etc. Let me say, for the price paid it is definately NOT worth it. Be prepared to be hungry afterwards. The portions are small and the fish is comparible to any AYCE japanese place, except you can't order more. We also ventured out and decided to order the SUSHI PIZZA, which in my opinion should be renamed sushi FEETsa. It smelt like my feet after a week of going camping with one pair of socks. It was also rock solid and each bite I thought my tooth was going to crack. ALL these people raving about it are either working there, knows someone that works there or have no taste buds or sense of smell. (Sorry if I'm being harsh)

the 2nd time I came here we hesitated but didn't feel like cooking ourselves and gave them the benefit of the doubt. I ordered the Zosui and my gf ordered the Nabeyaki udon. they were both Meh. My rice was pretty damn soggy. almost like a risotto but far more bland. How can you screw this simple dish? *sigh* My gf's order was ok but for $16 bucks premium it was as satisfying as bowl of instant noodles with ingredients bought at any chinese grocery store. 

And the 3rd and FINAL time we came here (recently) was the final straw. We order the Shabu Shabu hot pot. Which we were craving for since last week we had an awesome chanko nabe. the verdict: IT was flipping HORRIBLE! The soup base came out as plain tap water with a seaweed floating in it. The ingredients provided were slices of beef (bought at any T&T I presume) and the rest were an assortment of various veggies. for $38 bucks a person.. c'mon now.. I honestly felt like I was on some ""Punk'd"" show and Ashton Kutcher was going to come out with a camera crew after I paid for this.

Nami, We gave you 3 tries. Each time an utter disappointment. My humble apologies NAMI you are officially on my blacklist.

The one star I give this place is for the service. It was actually quite good.",5,BXlQO-sD4R1DwXPpMwd6JA

The lady I dealt with this time on the phone was much more pleasant to deal with and she provided the information I needed in a timely manner and was good with answering my questions.  She did apologize for my experience at the clinic from before and said that they took my review seriously and talked to all staff since then to improve customer service to ensure poor service does not happen again.  She said she did not want to lose me as a customer.  I did appreciate this a lot, but still feel it is only fair to leave my review below up as it is an accurate account of my actual experience there.  Until I am able to attend the clinic again in person and see if I do get good customer service with an appointment that is on time and honored, I obviously can't rate a better score until it actually happens.  However, I will at least give this good bit of review for all potential customers, still consider coming to this clinic for the optometrist and for the other good reception staff that I unfortunately never had the chance to deal with in person.

Original review:
I completely agree with the other review.  While the optometrist was nice and thorough, the overall experience was made terrible due to the horrible customer service provided by the reception staff.  Twice in a row they made us wait over 30 minutes even though we had appointments.  Both times they failed to let us know that the doctor would be late or give us any updates on why we were waiting so long.  They thought it was acceptable to just let us wait aimlessly.  One of the reception staff tried to address our wait time after 30 minutes had gone by with excuses. I ended up catching her in a lie and then she had the nerve to turn it around and blame me for the wait time, then shook her head while she walked away.  She even admitted they took a walk-in patient 5 minutes before our appointment and saw no wrong in this. Their only solution for doing this to us was to wait endlessly or come back another time.  Never have I had such terrible customer service!  I will never come back again and congrats to losing a customer within 2 visits in 2 weeks!  That has to be some sort of record!  It's sad that the optometrist will have to lose customers due to the reception staff.  Would definitely not recommend this place if you're looking for good customer service.",3,kt1Wi-ir1vx1X_DkV0xDmg

First time: The guy reset the heater.  it worked for about a day and stopped working again.  
Second time:  The guy said the heater was working fine, just that I had to put new AA batteries in my thermostat.  Unfortunately, I had to wait for four hours for the guy (he showed up close to noon), and I had to take off for some afternoon meetings, though I found out that evening it was still not working.  
Third time:  I was really busy at work, so ended up scheduling my appointment for almost a week later.  They still made me wait for about 3 hours.  

Finally, they got the heat working after three visits!  But then, in the summer, I noticed my air conditioner was dripping water!  Water was leaking off the ceiling and down the walls.  A guy came again and it turns out they had not properly replaced some pan!   So, in total, it took them four visits to get everything fixed.",10,H6KpNWM0nJwwjOOZv5WpfQ

But so far, the room is a total fail. We have a king tower premium room, which wasn't cheap. It didn't even come with a fridge, so we had to pay to have one delivered to the room.

The bedding was a joke. No comforter. I called down to housekeeping to ask about getting a comforter for the bed and was told they don't have any, but they would bring me extra sheets. I told them that was fine. Well, we waited for 2 hours and the extra sheets never came.

The electrical is wired wrong in the room. If you turn all of the lights off to watch TV, the TV turns off too! It's ridiculous! You have to watch TV at night with the lights on.

Two people, ordering a brie sandwich and burger, drinking water.

One staff member, who appeared overwhelmed, was looking after the entire restaurant (10 tables, the bar and the patio) with no help.
On a Saturday afternoon at 2pm, was completely unacceptable staffing.

The food was decent, but we still stopped for a palate cleanser within 10 minutes of eating. Lets just say that the burger had a distinct taste of ""blah"", with fries that must have been frozen (because they were stiff and cold). The brie sandwich was lacking flavour and, for $8, was nothing to write home about.

A couple of buddies told me about this place and how they have cheap yet satisfying food. My cousin and I took a trip on a Tuesday afternoon for some grub. The restaurant is located on the left when going north on Las Vegas Blvd on Wyoming. The place is quite clean and large with tables and booths.  

There are pictures of their food items posted all over the restaurant. Those helped with familiarizing myself with their food items but didn't help in the sense for me to choose what I wanted since they all looked so delicious! 

After reading Yelp reviews and getting a recommendation from the girl behind the counter, my cousin and I decided to get the Reina Pepiada. In between two warm cornbread slices, there was shredded chicken breast with avocado, mayo, cilantro and green peas. The consistency was almost like a chicken salad. I was a little thrown off with how warm the cornbread slices were and how cold the chicken concoction was. But I got past this in a hot minute and chowed down happily. 

We were given a red bottle (spicy hot sauce) and a yellow bottle (mild hot sauce) to have with our arepas. A little sprinkle of some hot sauce (I like the spicy but the mild is good, too) with each bite is key to elevate flavors. And a side note, don't be fooled by the ""small"" size of the arepa. This little baby fills you up. I walked out of there overly stuffed. 

To wash it all down, we each ordered a fruit juice. What's cool is that they let you try samples before you buy one. My cousin ordered the guava juice and I ordered the mango. I expected the juices to be a little thick, but they weren't. Very refreshing and not too sweet. Doesn't taste artificial. I think I will end up craving their mango juice during the hot Vegas summer months.

If you find a silly Asian girl chanting ""long live the arepa!"" here, that's me. If you find a female Asian bum on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd and Wyoming with a sign that says ""will work for arepas,"" that's me, too. That being said, you all get the point. Go get some arepas!",11,1EvZSNmhYmyPIElblCeMdA

When the aero press came, it had an interesting taste, almost a sour after taste. Not sure if it was the type of coffee we chose but it wasn't really to my liking.

After placing my cat on the counter inside one of their rooms, he began asking me how long our cat has been urinating around the house, what color was the urine. Then he prescribes our cat with some antibiotics, a urine-collector bottle and some plastic beads to place on our cat's litter so we can collect urine from it. So when I was at the counter, paying for all of this, they charged me around $70 for a physical examination when all the vet did was ask me questions about how long she'd urinate around the house and what color it was.

10$ can cancel anytime !

CONS- no indoor track , I don't like treadmills at all. I prefer personal exertion and not being guided by a belt lol

- the ""gymindation"" signs everywhere ( basically saying that you cant make grunting noises or drop weight or wear string tank tops because it can make members feel uncomfortable ?! That's the cheesiest corniest crap I have heard. The rules are kinda ridiculous. So if your striving to become the next Jay Cutler STAY AWAY FROM THIS GYM THEY WONT WELCOME YOU LOL.

I heard it was going to be a Canton Tea Restaurant (), but boy was I wrong. This is yet another typical Las Vegas Chinese restaurant with the same menu as everybody else in town (BBQ King, HK Star, etc.). There is nothing Canton or even HK style about this restaurant. They even serve Pho, which is already quite out of place, but they didn't even have it available when we were there. 

We came here the day after their grand opening and more than half their menu wasn't available to order. For veggies, they only had lettuce, nothing else, and they wanted to charge $7 for it. Seriously? SF supermarket is right next door. Is it that hard to walk over and buy some ingredients?

We ended up ordering two clay pots (which the waiter recommended we order because it would feed up to five people), but when it came, it looked look they were pizza hut personal pan style servings. The size of one pot looks like it wouldn't be enough for even one person, and they were charging $6 for it. Tony's review is correct, it literally looks like they just mixed up the rice with some meat, added some sauce and oil, then put it in the claypot. There were no crisp burnt rice sticking against the pot ().

We also ordered beef dry chow fun, which was ok tasting, but lacked the ""wok air"" (). We were still hungry, so we ordered some salty fish chicken fried rice. That was decent, but portion was small. 

Service: This is the most disappointing part of the experience. I understand it's their second day of operation, but the waiters literally looked like they just started working there for the very first time. Menus were not given to us immediately when we sat down. We had to remind them to give us the basic utensils and napkins. Tea was not promptly refilled when we were out. They literally didn't study their own menu. We ordered by dish name and they didn't know what the menu item # was or where to find it. This might be a pet peeve of mine, but I've NEVER EVER received my receipt in the check book thingy upside down.

I actually was happy with the service once I was actually seen. So the bad ending was the price that was given at the end of the service was not the same price given to my friends. I was charged for an extra $10 dollars for nail art which for them is included in a $10 polish change considering I had no polish on at all I think that was ridiculous. My clue was the shocked look on the receptionist face when she heard the pricing and my friend couldn't understand the big difference in the price.  I was surprised that they did not try to fix the situation when my friends are some of their best customers. I am the type of person who will totally talk up a place if the service is amazing, but sorry now I will tell everyone I know that the place is deceptive in pricing. I will look around my area for a place on yelp that offers the same services for prices that do change from person to person.",4,ar2BCCXscuVJC-sCj1xYmA

The club was very well set up. The only complain I have is that they don't play enough hip hop music. I think the majority of the music here should be rap and hip hop. I love to people watch and I noticed that no one would get a dance when the crappy music was on. But as soon as the hip hop plays you start seeing ass all around shaking and twerking all over the place. Its amazing.

The food was fine. They were out of figs for the fig/serrano/cheese item (one of our favorites at any tapas place). The taste of the food was fine, though not amazing. Overall a 3-3.5 stars for the food. We did order the mushrooms with snails and couldn't find any snails in our mushrooms. The wine (we ordered a half-bottle) suggestion from the waiter was good and reasonably priced.  This was all good.

Now the not so good... we ordered 7 items. We weren't hugely hungry and were considering dessert, so we erred on the side of caution (they suggest 5-10 per person). As expected, the items were small (they are called pintxos for a reason). Add to this the bread and it was a reasonably sized meal. The problem was with the timing.  I'm not sure if it is because we ordered fewer items than suggested or if they are always this disorganized, but we immediately got 2 of our tapas. The others came sporadically, often with a 15+ minute wait in between. At one point, they cleared our plates and eventually brought us new ones. However, we waited 30+ minutes for our last two tapas... that then came at the same time. During this time, waiters/servers passed through (checking for used plates??), but didn't stop, didn't ask if we'd like anything... eventually my husband had to stop our waiter to make sure that they were going to bring the rest. It had been so long we were assuming that they had forgotten.  Communication would have been appreciated.

All in all... we decided not to have dessert here - who knew how long we'd be waiting! And, unfortunately, we've decided not to return to Pintxos the next time we are in town. While the food is solid and typically an interesting mix, the service left a lot to be desired.",0,9Purj2RpH-q-t4mqCesapA

Housekeeping was very nice. They provided us with a large amount of towels so that was a ""+"". 

Imperial Palace's location is great!! to the right of the casino there's a liquor store just a few steps away. Eatery's are also of walking distance in the same direction IE. ""MC Donald's, Chipotle, Subway, Pizza and Chinese"". 

The pool is decent. Very chill. I stayed out there for about an hour just relaxing listening to the music and watching everyone play volleyball =).

What's also great is that each room looks like it has a balcony. So you get to feel how hot/ cold it is before stepping outside.

To some people pets are property, to others friends and family members.  To me...well I probably had what some might consider an ""unhealthy"" relationship with my cat, Jasper, whom my husband later so crudely dubbed ""The Big Sexy.""  But Jasper had been with me for more than 16 years, my husband only 8.  Who would you expect to have the highest rank in the house?

It was somewhat of a last minute decision to handle Jasper's final arrangements ourselves, rather than using the service provided by our veterinarian.  And I'm glad that we did.  I was impressed with the services Fairwinds offers. Their focus is as much on those ""surviving"" the loss, as well as the pet.  

Mary and Fairwinds are available to retrieve your pet valley-wide 24/7.  You may also bring your pet to them (no charge during regular business hours).  Fairwinds' services range from just the cremation to a clergy-presided service, and everything in between.   Mary will gladly accommodate special requests as well (paw impressions for example). 

We opted to take the Sexy in ourselves, and were warmly greeted by Mary and two new friends of the canine variety.  They were blissfully unaware that funeral homes are to be quiet, yet they were oddly comforting, especially to my husband who has always been a dog person.

All cremations are not only individual, but private as well (meaning only one animal at a time is cremated).  There are procedures in place upon your pet's arrival to ensure there are no mix-ups either.  I was 100% confident I would not be crying over a little bit of my Mr Man and a little bit of someone's schnauzer.  The website lists the pricing, but you can also choose just the services important to you, and not a ""package."" 

Mary handled the details professionally and personally.  It is clear she has a deep understanding of the bond some of us have with our pets, and she does everything she can to respect that bond.  Jasper's ashes were ready within 2 days.  We were given our keepsakes, a big hug, and resources should I need some serious therapy.  

So yes, Mary is ""as good as it gets.""  I hope my fellow Yelpers don't need to use her services, but she will be there if you do.",17,Rzf35jKV8e8EJdssrae_AA

I've had the Apricot Soup, Portobello Mushroom Soup, Corn Chowder.  All thumbs up!!!  I've had the veggie wrap, pork shoulder and lamb wraps.  Veggie and lamb were excellent.

I smothered what I could with tapatio and a touch of salt, but honestly I could have done the same thing with a can of beans.

The PIT Stop is a Boulder City institution.  I spent a summer working in Boulder City back in 1995 and we ate here regularly.  I don't make it back that frequently, but the nostalgia factor is tough to resist when I'm in the neighborhood.
I'm a big fan of the burgers...they probably aren't the best in the Las Vegas metro, but they are big and juicy and a great value.  They offer a couple different topping options including bacon, jalapenos, and green chiles.  The fries are fairly mediocre, but that mediocrity is eclipsed by the wonderful fry sauce and seasoning salt available on the table.  The milkshakes are also enjoyable...thick enough you need to eat with a spoon.
Although service can be a little hit or miss depending on how slammed the restaurant is (and believe me, it can get crazy in here), the waitresses are generally very friendly and are doing the best they can.  If you haven't been out to the PIT Stop, you should definitely make a trip out for the experience and to enjoy the charm that Boulder City has to offer.",0,8JnKfxdonJ8hCrDFOeV7pQ

Service was great, my food was decent. I ordered two eggs and kielbasa with toast and hash brown potatoes. I forgot to leave the tip, sorry.

It completely slipped my mind once I was heading for the door.

While my food and service was technically nearly perfect I did have one thing that sort of soured me on this place. This sort of thing may not bother you but it does bother me.

All the dining area table tops are covered with ads. There is a note in the corner showing that this is a service they get, table tops with ads.
I used to sell advertising for a living so I'm keenly aware what ads are worth and captive eyeballs too. Generally I avoid ads, I do not watch TV and seldom listen to the radio. Ads are becoming more and more intrusive and the ones online are increasingly rude. I use an ad blocker on my web browser, but having to sit and have a table top of ads staring at me while I wait for my food is what I would consider disrespectful.
To me, the decision to rent their table tops for ads means they do not respect me. I take it that they feel I am not a person but just an ""it"" to be advertised ""at."" 
While the service and food was fine I draw the line at being treated with disrespect, so I won't be returning to dine here. 
If this sort of activity doesn't bother you, please assume I gave this restaurant 4 stars for decent food and service but they lose one for disrespecting the very people that keep them in business, give them all jobs.",1,jLOqQMlhKfvfZ0CZMD4-8g

I actually remember the old Pittsburgh airport. I've done a ton of flying out of both the old and this new(er) version and the new(er) version is a complete improvement. Still, I wish the food options were more plentiful, open later, and spread more equally throughout the concourses. Security here is relatively tame (line speaking) when compared to more heavily traveled airports. PIT is no longer a HUB so it sees much less traffic these days. It's easy to navigate, there are no insanely long walks to terminals (I'm looking at you DCA!), and it's, relatively, clean. Moving walkways are always good, I never find this airport crowded, and if you forget reading material for your flight (I'm very guilty of this), there are abundant outposts to grab media to read. I appreciate there is free drop-off parking if you're there less than an hour since I and my brother semi-frequently fly here to visit my parents and need dropped off after. I know my parents, as Pittsburgh residents, wish there were more direct flights out of PIT. Even my brother, flying home to Boston, recently had to connect from PIT to Newark (???) then to Boston-I'm not sure why they couldn't do a direct flight more than once a day (which is why he had to book connecting) for that. Staff is at least good with kids-I've flown numerous times as a minor (many, many moons ago) alone and I always had a good experience. My  parents say security is now quick, but they also fly pretty frequently and are pre-approved for TSA. Overall, I think the breadth of flights was better when Pittsburgh was still a HUB, but it (mostly) gets our divided (by distance) family to where we need to go so that's a plus still!",1,gFsqraWQfG46ohVFRg_d3A

I've cut the majority of foods from my diet. So, I ordered the tofu with some sweet and sour sauce. First, the tofu wasn't cooked. It was rubbery and wet. When done right. Tofu should be dense with a bit of crisp. 
The sauce was okay, it was a bit too sweet. You could definitely tell it wasn't homemade.

CRht4ujXUsr95xfGoZVmQw,3,2015-06-07 21:38:02,4,b7TNNG28KBqCrtNr_C0eqQ,"So there's this karaoke rent-a-room and sing with friends type place that's been around forever - everywhere in the world it seems but just recently started up here. Or at least as far as I'm concerned - I'm always late to such parties. There's this place called August Karaoke Box (八月恋歌) in Tempe on the south side of University between McClintock and Rural - more specifically in the mall at University @ Dorsey that has businesses like Republic Ramen. You basically pass Republic Ramen and go south into the parking lot and it's in the same building on the east side of the building. There's also a rock climbing place to the south so it can be busy and the parking situation can vary. 

So... I've been here a few times with friends and there are things I like about it and things that I am not particularly pleased with. I'll break it down for y'all...

Pros:

1) During the weekdays of Monday through Thursday before 8 pm you pay 15 bucks an hour. That works out pretty cheap if you come with friends. It's usually not crowded in the afternoons at all. 

2) You get a private room so nobody sees you singing except for your friends if you're the shy type and are mortified about the idea of singing in front of people. This also allows you to try out songs you normally wouldn't dare without any embarassment when the song becomes a trainwreck. 

3) These rooms allow you to have a private party for as long as you like and are willing to pay for. 

Cons:

1) Catalog - I understand that the reason this KTV place even exists is the Chinese speaking clientele - which is why I wasn't too surprised when the receipt I got after paying was almost all in Chinese characters. That said they could use a much bigger English language artist catalog. It's funny that the Rod Stewart and Bee Gees song catalogs are much bigger than the Beatles catalog and there isn't any Rolling Stones at all that I could find. Nor could I find any Eagles. Or Led Zeppelin. Been here a few times and I can see the novelty fading pretty quickly after going through all the available songs that I like/know. It might be my lack of Karaoke GUI navigation skills but I searched by artist and looked at all the offerings for each particular artist. What's weird is you can type in songs by name and they sometimes come up even if the artist isn't listed in the artists section. Oh well. 

2) The way the lyrics show up on the screen are usually two lines at a time. During faster paced songs the transitioning of the lyrics to the next pair of lyrics can sometimes be slow enough that you can be caught waiting/wondering what the rest of the lyrics are (if you don't know the song too well). Most karaoke bar type setups have a full screen of lyrics at a time to avoid that. 

3) The backing tracks/video. So some of the songs have the actual music video or live video of the artists playing their songs. Some of them have some weird Chinese videos of women walking through the street but having nothing to do at all with the song itself. Awkward. But some of the audio tracks sound like MIDI - like you're listening to an old school arcade game rendition of that song. Fortunately not all songs are like that.

If you're a karaoke fan this might appeal to you to try at least once anyway. As always, your mileage may vary.",7,0d7gFJUi4cV3I7j1dHn9fQ

Last night I ordered the special which was snapper with farro risotto. The farro risotto is on the regular menu and my foodie friend had recommended that I order it. I was thrilled that it came with snapper last night, as I may have been tempted to order a different dish that included seafood or meat. The fish was good, but the risotto blew my socks off. It was an amazing blend of textures (nutty farro, al dente mushrooms, broccolini, and carrots), finished with a pumpkin oil seed oil and pecorino. All the flavors and quality ingredients came together in a perfectly balanced dish. I brought 1/2 of it home and have been enjoying all day. This is one of those dishes that stays in your memory forever. I hope Caffe Boa continues to serve it and it remains as delicious as it was last night. Bravissimo!",0,NgPnAPbGpZyhhJi-cPVC4g

Came here for breakfast while attending a conference at the Rio. I tried to go for lunch the day before, but restaurant closes at 1pm most days (they do brunch on weekends). Seriously, I thought if there was anywhere I was sure to find all day breakfast this was it, but no.

Menu is full of your breakfast standards and some signature spins on same. I got The Basic - 2 egg breakfast with sausage and biscuit. I wanted white toast but I was told they don't carry that. (What???) Eggs and sausage were acceptable. Potatoes were overdone, tasted of old fryer grease and took up 3/4 of plate. Biscuit was dry. Because of the potatoes, the portion was massive. 

And honestly, what is with the massive inedible Rosemary garnish? It doesn't add to the visual appeal of the dish, nor does it visually signify to you that there is Rosemary in the dish. I thought it was wasteful.

They make you pick out a fresh lobster from a bucket. Who knows if that's what you get though. There are tanks upon tanks of lobsters in aquariums lining the walls of the restaurant. The lobsters are literally piled up to the max in the tanks. Some looked dead. I actually reported this to the humane society to investigate as it is not in keeping with the animal welfare bylaws. Just a gross place with gross food. There was no flavour or anything appetizing about the food. We ordered a side of veggies which were just boiled in water and tossed on the plate, still wet.

We reserved a table for nine at 6pm and were seated by 6:15. We ended up with a large table in the corner near the kitchen. The table had a mix of four chairs and two long benches, so that was interesting (table was sort of too high though). Three in our party couldn't make it, but that was a blessing in disguise because it afforded us the chance to spread out and be more comfortable. 

The restaurant's design is a mix of modern, trendy and rustic (brick walls and benches) that blended nicely together. Loved the ambient lighting - very cozy and romantic! This is a great place for dinner and drinks with friends (inside) and for a date (patio area). 

Our waitress Meschelle was one of the best servers I've encountered at any restaurant. She was very attentive to our needs and knowledgeable about the food and drink options; her suggestions were spot on. 

To start, we ordered a bottle of the Clean Slate Riesling ($35, a white imported from Germany), the parmesan risotto ($10) and the baked goat cheese ($10). I loved the Riesling - it was light, crisp, slightly sweet, and very smooth. The BCG came out first - the crostini was too hard and the baked goat cheese, pesto and tomato sauce was too tart. The risotto was plated nicely and tasted even better. I loved the caramelized brussel sprouts, cippolini onions and the slices of cajun ham; each bite was lovely. One of the gals said it was cooked too al dente for her, but it was fine to me. 

Next we ordered a bottle of the Catena Malbec ($43, a red imported from Argentina). The wine is a beautiful, deep red with a full-bodied, smooth flavor - which went well with my entree (the prime hanger steak, $24, cooked medium well). The others ordered the Moroccan meatballs ($15), pot roast ($19), roasted chicken ($17), and two of the roasted salmon ($22 each). My steak was served on a bed of whipped (mashed) potatoes, veggies (arugula/sliced boiled potatoes/slices of artichoke) and topped off with a red wine sauce. Other than the boiled potatoes being too al dente, my entree was SO GOOD. (I think the steak would have tasted better if I had it cooked medium.) I tried a bite of the Moroccan meatball, pot roast, and roasted chicken; all tasted great! The pot roast was so tender and full of flavor; the best pot roast I've tasted thus far. This will be my entree of choice when I visit again. Everyone gave the food two thumbs up.

Next we ordered a bottle of the Hullabaloo Zinfandel ($39, a red from Napa Valley). The wine is a beautiful deep red, but too full-bodied for my taste - especially since we're moving on to dessert. I wanted to order the Moscato to go with dessert, but was outvoted - wah, wah. We ordered the chocolate spice cake ($8) and cheesecake in a jar ($8) to share. Although the spice cake was presented beautifully, and was served with maple pumpkin gelato, I was not sold. The initial bite of the cake was full of chocolate flavor, but then the spice hits the palate and it was too strong. However, the cheesecake in a jar was AWESOME! I tried only one bite, but savored each burst of flavor. What made the cheesecake great was the almond crumble.

Our bill came to $297, not inclusive of the 20% gratuity we added to the bill. Not a bad price to pay for great food, great wine and quality time with friends. ;)

Understanding that it is Vegas and people make fools of themselves but when I went through the precheck line, an extremely intoxicated man was making a fool of himself, holding up the line by being too drunk/high to follow simple protocol, harassing every woman around him (including a TSA employee), yelling a man for touching his bag as it was clogging the scanner line because he was too busy catcalling to take it, and taking TSA's pat down gloves and blowing them up like balloons.

The ambiance was very trendy and the outside seating area was perfect for people watching. Although they had two TVs I wouldn't recommend for watching the big game or anything. The mood was a bit too relaxed for that.

PROS-
* Location: relatively central to everything, including the caesars forum shops (YES!!!)
* Room service: pretty speedy AND they have the most delicious chicken wings ever when you're drunk. My friends and I were in awe of how meaty and crispy yet flavorful they were, even in our hyper wasted state.
* We gave the receptionist a $20 and she gave us a free upgrade to their ""red room."" It was more modern and upgraded than their basic room, but we got stuck with a handicap shower... you know, those huge wide showers that just have the shower curtain blowing around while the water sprays the bathroom floor.
* However, despite the aforementioned problem, the water pressure that came out of the shower head was pretty awesome.
* they also give you some pretty good coupons with your stay, like a free frozen hot chocolate at serendipity w/purchase of an entree. And if you've been to serendipity, you know that the frozen hot chocolate is WHERE IT'S AT!

CONS-
* the parking structure is SO FAR from the actual hotel elevators and reception area, you have to walk through all the restaurants and shops to get there.
* the handicapped shower, like I said before.
* there are NO MIRRORS in the actual bedroom area. There was only a mirror over the sink, and a mirror on the bathroom door. This makes it very difficult for us ladies to get ready at night.
* the hotel as a whole just has an old feel to it. old interior, old people, oldass balloon outside (have you ever noticed how old and faded that thing is??)

Even though there seemed to be more people, it still was not too crowded. They take over a large area of the Steele Indian School Park and so there is plenty of space for the brewers' tents to spread out. Some of the more popular breweries had long lines but the best strategy is just to get a sample and then immediately get in line for the next place you want to try and by the time you get to the front of the line you will be done drinking your sample from the previous place. I loved the fact that most of the brewers had water available for you to rinse out your cup. They seemed to be keeping closer track of the tickets this year but really since you get 16 two oz samples and most of the beers are really strong, there is no need to cheat and try to get more.

There was a fantastic representation of the AZ breweries from Tucson, Phoenix, Flagstaff, and Pine (yay THAT Brewery!) and they were handing out a pamphlet with a map of all the breweries in the state on it. That was pretty cool. I also made a new discovery: Odell Brewing Company from Fort Collins, CO. I am not sure how it is possible that I have never heard of them before since they seemed to be a favorite there at the festival. Even though most of what they had brought to sample was too hoppy for me, I tried a black IPA that was very smooth and enjoyable. I had a cool conversation with one of the dudes in the tent and he recommended their chocolate milk stout (doesn't that just sound AMAZING??) so I will definitely be looking for that on my next trip to the liquor store.

It was a bright and sunny day but this year they seemed to have a larger shaded area and plenty of chilled water. They also stepped up their food options. Nothing gourmet or anything but at least it was decent food. The BBQ was actually really good. I also really enjoyed the bands there, though I didn't catch any of their names. I absolutely did not enjoy the karaoke singers, however. ;0) I guess the people with the mic had fun with it but none of them should try out for American Idol any time soon. The only room for improvement I can suggest to the festival organizers is to offer some discounts for cab companies. I know they were encouraging people to take the light rail since it stops right next to the entrance to the park on Central and Indian School but that is not practical for those of us who live out in the suburbs. According to Valley Metro's website it would have taken us 1hr 45 min to get there on public transportation. And the quote I got from discount cab was $50 each way.",3,Tsm8VraTp5OGyVALtUiCeQ

The views of the strip were outstanding.The beds are the most comfortable from all the hotel casinos I have stayed at - Venetian, Luxor, Treasure Island, Hilton and Aladdin.  I must have slept for over 7 hours and I usually do not sleep for more than 5 hrs in Vegas. The bed definitely had something to do with that. 

  MGM is one of the nicer casinos to play at and they have some of the better restaurants - Fiamma, Shibuya, NobHill, Wolfgang Puck and L'Atelier Joel Robuchon. I ate at Wolfgang Pucks bar and grill since I was not in the mood for French(L'Atelier), Italian ( Fiamma) or Japanese. But I hear they are all very good restaurants.  The Davidoff cigar shop is another plus.",1,PQqXijgnlNifNiIyYYX8DQ

Invariably, the services comes at a cost of ambiance or service.  Not so Gen.  they've stepped up their game by offering a massive 36 item menu for an AYCE - reasonably priced at $21.99.

Their premium steak is served in 12-16 oz cuts 1/2 in thick.  All the fixins you can expect from a Korean BBQ.

The ambiance is bathed in blue hues - we'll have to come back at night instead of dusk.  Service is over the top.  As you'll have guessed, I am impressed by the sixth sense good servers have - realizing before you do, that you've finished your pop or need a refill of bean paste.

Everything there is great, but I am specifically writing this with the seven layer bar in mind. In fact, I have no idea how there isn't a single Yelp review that mentions this slice of heaven.

The seven layer bar (7LB) is made up of chocolate, coconut, oats, some sort of nut, and three other things that are almost unbearably delicious. The slice is $3 a pop, but it is a fairly large square and it is worth every penny and calorie. It's always available because it is their best item and boy does Cora know that. Cora (or the woman I presume is Cora) always lights up when I ask for a 7LB and readily admits that it is pretty much the best thing ever.

Cora's always puts out a table on the weekends in the summer and has its regular pastries and lemonades. The stuff is fairly pricey but I think everything that isn't a cupcake is amazing. The cupcakes are overpriced and aren't the most competitive, but fear not, because you can get a 7LB.

The best friend wanted an ear piercing.You know,the kind you can get at Piercing Pagoda from some high school kid working their way through summer.
Well,he had his earring with him(14k gold stud).The person who came to assist us refused to do the piercing because she stated it HAD to be done with a hoop not a stud...
Her reasoning had to do with proper healing,infection etc...
He stated he could not wear even the smallest of hoops to work,but could wear a small non descript stud.
She was pretty insistant and not the most pleasant in her explanation of why she could not place the jewelry he requested.
In fact,she was downright arrogant and condescending.
Since she was adamant about only placing hoops,I asked if I could bring my gold hoops in and have my nipples pierced.
Then she tells me she could not place hoops only barbells!!!!!!!!
Okay,I'm starting to understand now...
She doesn't want our business.
Why?Dunno.Maybe we weren't cool enough for her or something.Or maybe it was decreed we were too mundane in our simple piercing choices.
Whatever.
So,we take a trip over to West Coast Beauty Supply where I have an account,purchase a disposable piercing kit for 6 bux,go back to his place and I did the piercing for him.
With a stud.
It never gave him any trouble either.No infection,no problems healing,his ear never did fall off.
And no,he did not return the favor of assisting with my piercings!lol
I will have those taken care of the next time I see Fakir in California...

He clearly hated his job and didn't try to hide it. I asked him why he was not in a good mood and he explained that he had been there since 10am.

I told her I would have to come in on my lunch break so I had limited time and she understood. I walked in there today ON MY LUNCH BREAK to have them fix my nails and she came to the counter telling me that she would have to charge me to fix them! She said there was nothing she could do because they weren't ""under warranty"" when I left the salon. She made me come to the salon just to tell me she she could ""fix"" it but she would have to charge me for the service!

 It's 6 am, your two year old woke up hungry and, you'll never guess, demanding. Buzzberry is a quick option. You order oatmeal for the boy & soy latte for you, but make a point to have it CHILDS HOT. Both come out steaming like it was cooked in a crematory. After 5 minutes of blowing on it, you ask for ice. 6 ice cubes later you assume it's ok. Your little one tries it and all hell breaks lose; oatmeal spit everywhere, crying, screaming, trying to do everything to keep it from burning his tongue. (Keep in mind you did test it but underneath was still hot.) Frustrated, you ask for a bag and voice the fact nothing was what you specifically asked for... You get a blank look. Not we'll fix it or I'm sorry. So, your kids bent out of shape in tears & your $6 latte is watered down in ice with generic sugar... Awesome start of the day!

And it has a mild but grunchy smell all throughout the gaming floor, beyond the usual cigs-and-coconut ""eau du casino"" ... there's like an odd fried food edge to it or something. 

That's about it, though. If you can deal with all that it's OK enough for a 3, at least if you can somehow get a decent price (and you'll have the best chance here of all the MGM properties short of Circus Circus, as this is considered their second-lowest-tier only to that one). 

I spent one night in the Resort Tower (the most basic one), on one of those ""comped but you still have to pay the $32 resort fee"" offers. Was on a weekend though so it was a pretty good deal. Check-in line was surprisingly short too, at least if you get there just before/around check-in time. Later on it's probably awful, I know it was over at the Luxor around 5 PM the one time I stayed there on some random weekday. 

The room is at least a small step up from a budget motel. Better bed, and the wifi is surprisingly fast and good for a system that is open to anyone in the casino (not just hotel guests). Bonus points for the bathroom ventilation fan, which you rarely see in casino towers for some reason. Basic otherwise. No coffee maker or fridge. 

Gaming floor is whatever. Food is all expensive but that's the entire Strip. At least the food court has plenty of seating and you can just go kick it there for an extended period if you want to sit down.",3,nNlRYWO00FvLVQx9Hp6_dw

I probably wouldn't have found this place without Yelp reviews. It's a small restaurant in a strip mall that I wouldn't go to often otherwise at Leslie and York Mills. My experience with all-you-can-eat Sushi has typically been that it's pretty awful.

Sushi Kiku is definitely not the nicest sushi that I've ever had, but it's pretty decent, and for the all-you-can-eat tradeoff, well above average. It'll beat most grocery store and buffet sushi handily, but it's probably not going to come that close to your favorite sushi spot.

You order your food, rather than pick it from a buffet, and they're pretty consistently good. There's a few dishes that stand out for me (Sirloin, Basa Filet, Beef & Enoki Mushroom, Cold Tofu, Unagi) and a few I wouldn't order again (Las Vegas Roll), but most are just good.

We paid extra for the fried rice and planned to split the entree between us. 10 minutes for our order to be up was spot on!

We appologised and offered to pay a fee, but The Lady  preferred to sit us at a corner booth instead . 

With attitude she then asked us if anyone else was coming and added a Chair at the End of the table for the one person missing . 

Whe then ordered drinks with the waitress whom by the look on her face felt more then akward of her bosses reaction . 

We all ordered a Speciality house cocktail as well as 2 bottles of red wine . The wine was great ( 36$) The Co ktails were ... water , No Taste , a waste ... 

We then ordered the main Course to Share @59.99$ for 2people Dégustation Menu . Which was very well explained by our waitress . 

The warm cloths used to clean our hands  were sented of lavender .  

The food I found to be very tasty quite spicy . I love the fact that we eat with our hands , all digging in the same big plate of food . 

I loved the appetiser !!! 

Being the fist time doing so I was affraid of getting food all over myself . 
The little ""Crepes"" used to grab the food makes it safe . lol ! 

We then got served an honey cider ,I did not like it
actually no one at our table did , again no taste.

We had for desert sample portions of cake @3.50$ each .  The best one was Pinneaple ! The others were ... bahh . 

At some point one of my guests asked for an appetiser to the ""Frustrated Boss Lady "" and she rudelly said "" the kitchen will be closing soon . "" and walked away without looking twice our way. 

No sorry ... No nothing ... 

Our bill came up to 160$ for two people Drinks included and tip. 

In resume , I had a good time with my friends and ate some Good Ethiopian food .  The drinks suck and wine is Ok .

Gyubee impressed me with their excellent, high quality BBQ.  The meats were very clean and were very good cuts.  They also provide you with options of marinated or not marinated for some of their popular BBQ selections like the beef short ribs.  The price per person is slightly over $30 for a dinner, but I think Guybee is competitively priced given their higher quality BBQ meats.

We ordered a variety of meats: marinated beef, unmarinated beef short rib, marinated beef short rib, pork, pork sausage, chicken, shrimp and squid.  Additionally, we ordered some of their vegetables including zuchini, enoki mushroom, king oyster mushrooms, etc.  Complimentary side dishes such as kimchi and rice can also be requested.

Service at the restaurant was ok.  They responded when we needed them and brought us the correct orders.  Time between ordering and receiving the food varied.  It was fastests right at the beginning of the meal and gradually slowed down during the course of the dinner (to their credit, we got everything we ordered and nothing was missed, though I would have liked them to bring food a little faster later in our meal, it could have been due to more customers and more work for the servers).

A couple of things of note:  
1. Guybee has a 2 hour time limit.  After 2 hours, you can no longer make any orders except for desserts, it made us feel a bit rushed and they strictly enforce the time limit. 
2. Similar to many of its BBQ competitors, Guybee will change your grill for you once during your meal, at your request.

I was debating with myself whether Gyubee was a 3 star or a 4 star when we finished the meal and were splitting the bill.  Somehow, our group we miscalculated for the bill (which includes service charges - they did not bother pointing it out to us) and we were $0.10 short of the bill total.  This led the server to give us an extremely rude lecture about paying correctly (put it into context - I acknowledge we made a mistake, we were short $0.10 on a bill over $150) and decreased my overall satisfaction of Gyubee.

Nevertheless: Quality BBQ, passable service. 3.1 / 5.0",1,2K62MJ4CJ19L8Tp5pRfjfQ

However, living in Las Vegas for almost 10 years, I'd always wanted to see these guys live.  Hearing about them around the time I was in junior high school, their brand of magic got my attention right away.  This is not just simply watch closely and be amazed with what I can do with my hands type of artistry, this is completely different.

Certain tricks do involve slight of hand yes, but other tricks, some of them you'll be scratching your head for days wondering ""how'd they do that???""  I got tickets for my fiancée's birthday last January and we got seats towards the far right side of the audience about 5-8 rows away from the stage which still offers a great view. However, this is the reason why this show loses a star.

The seating...is not the most comfortable.  I think they are hoping for people that are not particularly wide in nature to sit in this theater because they have a thick armrest with a metallic base between each seat that is IMMOBILE.  That's right, you cannot, no matter how hard you try, lift or remove the arm rests between the seats.  This caused a lot of discomfort for my fiancée and I because it was difficult to sit in one position for more than 10-20 minutes and we couldn't hold each others hands very easily.  Also, there's no place to put your jacket if you come in with one unless you stuff it under your seat, and that may be fine for some, but I for one hate throwing my jacket on the floor of anyplace and stuffing it under my seat in hopes that I will still find it there when I leave as well as find that nothing's been stolen from it so we basically just had to hold our jackets in our laps the whole time.  Really hope they do a remodel of their seating for the future.

So, the show itself, is a combination of illusion and stand up comedy.  Penn is a very outspoken man.  That's nothing new.  He spoke a lot about the TSA and laws and human rights and went so far as to produce his own miniature metallic copy of the Bill Of Rights and of course gave everyone notice that the item was available for purchase when they leave the show.  I got a bit of a George Carlin vibe from Penn in fact.

Teller of course just has to appear and pull some interesting facial expressions and you get a great laugh.  He also has tons of funny items he'll pull out of his pockets.  His shtick reminded me a lot of Harpo Marx.

The crowd involvement was a nice touch, few magicians allow more than 4-5 people to come up on stage to volunteer during their shows, but Penn and Teller allowed practically 5 rows of people to come up on the stage to watch them make a cow disappear!  Also, before the show, you're invited to come up on stage and sign an envelope as part of a trick involving prediction of what someone is reading.

The other thing that I would recommend to people going to the show is to actually be prepared to potentially BE involved! This is a show! It's supposed to be fun! The gentleman they had come up on stage for the part of the envelope trick had absolutely no emotion.  He spoke in a very monotone voice and had a way about him like ""Oh yeah, I'm up on stage with Penn and Teller...it's getting late...I hope I can still manage to have sex with my wife while I'm still in Las Vegas and take advantage of that all you can eat prime rib for $9.99...""

Again, it's a SHOW! You're here to see a show!  Have fun! Look at what's happening up on stage! You're going to be amazed at what you see! If you're just going to see a trick and then say to yourself, ""Oh yeah, I know how that's done..."" or ""I gotta look that up online when I get home so I can figure out how they did it and post it to my Facebook page to spoil it and say ""You'll NEVER have to go see Penn and Teller after watching this video!"""" then you're in the wrong place Mister.

I really enjoyed getting a chance to take a photo with Penn after the show.  I'd seen him before many times being a local here in Las Vegas.  From a local movie theater, to the AVN show, to just a random spotting at the Venetian.  My fiancée also told him how much we enjoyed seeing his appearance on an episode of Modern Family.  

Again, Penn and Teller are not for everyone, but if you say to yourself ""Hey, they've been playing in Las Vegas for a while now, maybe I should check them out..."" you may just be surprised at what you'll see!

I ordered a Caesar Salad with Shrimp ($22.00); there were 3 large shrimp but they were tough, stringy and tasted fishy. I could only eat 2 of them and I was worried about my digestive health thereafter.

My cousin also ordered the Caesar Salad with extra anchovies. She liked her salad.

CC is about 5 miles from my new casa - kinda of an unusual location. parking sucks. has the 50's diner feel. 

so i go for the 1/2 pounder, medium, blue cheese, sauteed onions ( for a 50's diner, should they be grilled onions or sauteed onions ? ) a basket 0f fries and onion rings ( the menu says for 1-2 people, i say it's for 2-4 people ) and an almond joy malt. Total cost - $20 !! damn, that's an expensive brunch ! 

the burger - cooked medium - i'm impressed with that, but no seasoning to it - call me picky but i just feel a burger tastes better when it's seasoned while cooking as opposed to salting/peppering it after its cooked . also, the meat itself fell apart a little too easily. I still liked the burger but i liked the fries/onion rings but charge a $1 for a dipping sauce ?!? that's bullshit ! 

the malt ? needed more malt, the coconut taste not too noticeable at the beginning of the malt, but very strong at the end.

Ended our dinner with the Cake Shake -- to be honest, I wasn't a big fan of that either. The presentation was great, but it was just too much going on and too sweet. I think I got diabetes from just looking at it. I mean, if you've got a sweet tooth, by all means, go for it.

I am not sure if this was because the sign was not lit up or what. But, they are just 2 weeks old and maybe that hasn't been done or something. Just we aware that the sign might not be lit up when you go.

Venue: It is actually kind of neat inside. There didn't seem to be any ""prime tables"" as all the tables were pretty much just 4-tops. Also, not a lot of seclusion if you are looking for that. About 40% of the venue is a bar, but isn't separated from the restaurant. Real sleek, suave bar. The kitchen is open. So, if the cook is spitting in your food then you will probably see them. I kind of liked having the open kitchen in a small venue.

Food: I had the Green Chili Stew with macaroni and cheese. Go ahead, laugh at my mac & cheese. The green chili was a touch spicy but then again, I am a total spice sissy. Even with that said, it *was* good. I ate it all. 

The mac and cheese was a different story. I jokingly ordered that right off the bat and our server raved about it. Said he loved it. My guest also ordered it. Without a doubt, the mac and cheese was awesome. Really, I think it was better than my green chili stew.

Cost: It cost us $48 for two people. This was with 2 mains, 2 sides, an iced-tea, and an alcoholic beverage. Not bad.

Bottom Line: I see this place succeeding... especially if people can find it with their light off outside.",0,1DsuFRjdW0gDA23Xswzoqg

I felt like there weren't too many of any one particular maki so I wasn't bored of what I was eating. We also ordered one '5 seasons' roll which was fresh fish wrapped in a rice paper roll. I love these types of rolls because there's no extra rice to fill you up; just filled with the good stuff! Fish is reasonably fresh, no fishiness at all.

The ambiance is nice (although the country music channel their TV is stuck on is a little strange) and the service is good, but... the food was just so terrible that I can't give anything more than a 1 Star rating. 

Our table ordered the Pad See Ew, Pad Thai, and Silver Noodle soup, along with an egg roll appetizer. The egg rolls were decent, if a little oily - sadly, that was the best bite I had of the evening. Everything else was just so greasy, oily, and relatively tasteless, that I could only stand eating the food for the first 2 minutes. After that, the piping-hot temperature that was making the food half-bearable gave way to terrible lack of taste and an inedibly slimy texture for everything. We all agreed that it was a pretty bad food night. 

This has to be one of the first times that I didn't finish the food at a restaurant - I usually finish my entree, and if I don't, I always make sure to take the leftovers home. But not this time, which is a minor anti-miracle in my food-universe. I didn't take anything home from our evening at Corner Thai, besides a bad taste in the mouth and a bit of pity for the nice server who had to listen to that country music station all day.

First, their system for taking orders makes no sense. I had to tell the person in charge of cutting the bagels what I wanted, then repeat my entire order to a man not five feet away so he could punch it into the POS system.

Second, the gentleman behind the counter was incredibly rude. I ordered a cold-brewed coffee, but noticed that the one carafe marked ""iced coffee"" was empty. When I informed the employee behind the counter, he responded that he had prepared two carafes of cold brew, then directed me to a carafe filled with boiling hot coffee.

Third, the baskets in which they serve the bagels don't fit their trays, so when my wife grabbed her tray, one of our bagels slid right off onto the floor. They remade the bagel for free, but the gentleman behind the counter was a jerk about it.

I'm not sure what compels people to come here. Their ""New Yorker"" uses the same toppings as Einstein Bros., to the one, with no discernible increase in quality. I can easily buy red onions, capers, and lox and prepare the dish at home.

This place has a hibachi grill where you can make grilled shrimp or ask for a piece of steak. The steak was not flavorful, took a bite and tossed.

Amazing egg drop soup, not sure what is in it, maybe overload of MSG. Either way, gets the job done and I definitely had two cups. They also have chicken soup here which I've never seen at any other chinese restaurant or buffet, did not look enticing enough to try.

When I told them that my ribs were cold they didn't offer to warm them, instead  they said that the air conditioner vent above me was the reason for the cold ribs!  Cocktail refills were hard to get.

They used standard lip service to talk away the conerns rather than taking action to cure.  The manager took our glass for a wine refill and literally 10 minutes later returned with a refill.  He offered it for free because he reolised the failure in proper service.

The food tasted great.  Their service left a bad taste.  We took the ribs to go.  Went elsewhere for dessert and drinks.",0,rjJIt6Q7FkmXiFm-2oWoqQ

Ordered the fish special which was the sea bass.  Told the server that I'm on a restrictive diet and he described the dish as simply pan seared served with Mashed potatoes and veggies.  Asked for no potatoes.  Had a great gazpacho soup first.  Huge portion. Wrapped up half.  The fish came and it was covered in buttered shiitake mushrooms which I removed and it wasn't properly pan seared.  In fact, there was so much oil that it was more poached. I had a family member try it and she agreed it was ""rich"".  No big deal.  It happens.  But the response from the staff was like a Kitchen Nightmares episode.  When asked how I liked my meal, and my response was, ""it's a little rich"", the server said that everyone loves the sea bass!  People come in just for the sea bass (not a menu item).  This is how Mediterranean food is prepared!  There was no offer to refire or choose another item.  Then the Chef came out of the kitchen to berate me.  I had to ask him to leave the table.  When the check came, I asked if my gratuity can go to the table runner because she was sweet.  The server said, ""I don't care if you don't give me a gratuity but I'm your server.  I didn't know the chef was going to come out to your table.  I didn't tell him to.  I told the owner your complaint and she said that you have to pay for everything because you ate it all (ummmmmm.... I ate a bit).

My sister ordered a Coal Burger, Sweet Potato Fries, and a small drink. I ordered a bacon burger with normal fries. This came out to 28 dollars with tip. After purchasing this, I thought it'd be a big burger, right? Nope! It was around the same size as In n Out's. The quality wasn't that bad, but it was downright ridiculous for the price.

Intro to the restaurant. I bumped into another friend on the street and we entered the restaurant together and mentioned our friend's name and the 8:00pm reservation. One of the hostess responded that our table was not ready until 9pm and proceeded to show us the lounge area and mumbled something about please sit and have drinks...and who was going to take my coat for coat check? So far, not the best start. 

Food. Origin serves dishes tapas style and I came HUNGRY in preparation for the event so perhaps I was a bit biased when I say the food was not enough. The selection of foods is another matter entirely. I felt there was no rhyme or reason to the flow of courses...one dish contains Asian snap peas, another beef cooked in Thai style (SALTY), another sushi, another fried chips with guacamole, another bruschetta and then fries. If the intention was to showcase various cuisines of the world, then each dish was done at a level called mediocre. All in all, I was disappointed in the food. To be fair, we had a menu specially prepared for the birthday event so I am not sure if the regular menu is any different...I will not be going back to find out however. 

Ambiance. What can I say...it was a windy night and as I entered the restaurant, I was swallowed by two heavy purple curtains right at the entrance. Beware! Once inside, the decor is the usual kit-shy historical items that have some significance to the building/area/period of time, Godzilla chandeliers, modern photography that looks like a cup to one person but really is an upside down tree to another blah, blah, blah...nothing special. Towards the end of the night, it appeared a certain area of the restaurant turned into a dance floor so its a two in one place.

My husband and I went in on a Tuesday to place an order for plain white subway tile for our kitchen backsplash that we would be installing ourselves. We met with a man named Jim who did not have great customer service but that was fine since he was to the point. We gave him our measurements, he gave us a price and we were told the tile would be in Friday and to expect a call from them Wednesday morning to confirm the order. We never received a call (little did I know this would be a trend with Tanner Materials). I then called them on Thursday just to make sure everything was good for Friday since I had not yet heard from them. Spoke with Jim again and he had no clue who I was. We were on the phone for about an hour in which I found out no order had been placed, giving my measurements to him again, and quoted an insane amount more than we were originally (later to find out he did not have the right measurements). At the end of the call I was told times similar to what I wanted were in stock at MSI and I was to pick them up Friday after work. Jim also stated he would give me a call in the morning to confirm (this I highly doubted) but took his word for it. Morning came and went so I called and again spoke with Jim. And again he had no clue who I was or what I was talking about. After a while I was given the address to go pick up the tiles that were to be set aside for me. MSI was 45 minutes from my job (without traffic). I get to the front desk and they have no idea what I am talking about. I call Tanner once again and this time it was the son. The son also had no clue who I am so I had to re-explain everything for about the 5th time in 2 days. He and MSI states they had no clue what I was told or why but they did not have any of my tiles in stock. The son then stated and I quote ""Trust me I wish I could keep my father off these phones. I spend all day cleaning up his messes."" He then said he would see if his other vendor had the tiles in stock. Turns out they did not. I explained that I needed the tiles this weekend so they could be installed to be ready for an event. Asked if the tiles were ordered if they could install them and was told there was no way he could help me with that either. I asked if there was nothing he could do for me and he stated he simply could not help me. And that was it.

We went this evening, May 4, 2016 and were happy to see a mostly full restaurant.  We ordered our usual queso dip and ""Fajitas Valarta"" for 2.  The first sign something was a little off was the queso.   I commented that it was runny.  Ok, maybe it's just the way the batch was made, move on, right?

Next the fajitas for 2 came out sizzling just like it always does.  This time however, the plate featured LOTS of peppers and onions sizzling and little else.  There were 5 or so shrimp, like always, but very little in the way of beef or chicken.  Very little.  

I actually called the waiter over and asked if this is how the dish is made now.  He said that they have cut the portions but it did seem small.  He took it to the kitchen and was quickly turned around.  He apologized and said that this is how the dish is now served.  We said ok and just stared at it - stuck in that moment where you decide if you're going to take one for the team and eat or roll.  We decided we'd eat and just not return, lesson learned.  However, as I sat there for another minute or two I was so disgusted that I decided to portion out the chicken and beef.  In doing so we determined we had about 2oz of chicken and maybe 2 oz of beef to go with our 5 shrimp.  This is for a ""fajitas for 2"" combo, mind you.  I should have taken a picture of the beef and chicken separated out but the waiter took it back before I thought to do it.  He again apologized and we politely told him we wouldn't be back if this is the new reality.

I'm thinking that without the revenue a liquor license would generate that the Casa can't make the margins they need to survive.  It's a pity because it was previously a nice place considering the quality of the food and portions.

LFmH7oUMwxZV2KzcoRE2pQ,0,2014-07-30 13:49:36,0,xCV_PbAdHAsLET5dvqHY9Q,"Ok, so this place is a big box dental corporation. This is not your average individually owned/family owned dental practice. My first appointment I was told over the phone that they schedule two visits; one to clean your teeth and one for the X-rays/consultation. I'd never heard of that and thought it was odd and inconvenient, but agreed to go. Oddly,  they did all of it in the first appointment, so I'm not sure why I was initially told this. 

The dental hygienist starts off by telling me that because I was 2 months past due for my last 6 month cleaning that I ""probably had some form of gum disease/periodontal disease"" and I needed to ""prepare myself"" for that. This was before she'd taken one look in my mouth. She then pulls out a book filled with pictures of people with advanced gum and periodontal disease and makes me look at each picture. By this time I'm wondering what kind of dental office I'm in because NONE have ever done this and I know full well I have healthy gums. 

She then takes about 40 pictures of my teeth. I normally have bite wings done and every 5 years they'll do the full mouth X-ray, but I've never had actual camera type pictures taken. It took a good hour. 

Finally she starts the exam and unbelievably I have NO gum disease nor periodontal disease. In fact the dentist (when he finally appeared) said I have excellent gums and bones, which I already knew. 

The same hygienist then starts using high pressured sales techniques to get me to buy one of their electric toothbrushes. I told her I like the one I have and she made snide comments like,""well if don't want the best"" etc...She then informed me I'd be charged $80 for this visit. I have NEVER been charged for a 6 month cleaning/exam. I have insurance and it's free. She said I would be charged $56 for an oral cancer screening and $24 for fluoride. I declined both and that's when she got nasty. She kept trying to make me agree and I would not. I finally told her I forgot my checkbook and she said to me with a look of disgust,""oh so you didn't come prepared to your visit today."" I was so shocked by her comment that I just sat there speechless. 

Bottom line, if you need affordability for things like crowns and root canals, this is a good place. Luckily I've never had a root canal, but I needed a crown due to a cracked tooth and they quoted me a price about $300 lower than where I actually got the work done. I'm told their prices are low for other things too. However, I believe they lie to uninformed patients and scam them. Beware and absolutely get a second opinion!",16,dvnGnx6WcaA-icSwKHeuiw

Logistically, if you're staying in a resort in the area (such as Aria, Vdara, Bellagio, Monte Carlo, NY NY or MGM Grand) you can easily walk to the arena and avoid any associated traffic/parking hassles.

We walked from Vdara through Monte Carlo and out the side entrance, which drops you at a pedestrian cross walk across from the arena.  Arena event personnel will lead you across the street.  We arrived about 30 minutes before the show and stood in line for a good 20-25 minutes.  Anticipate the wait in line and bring an adult beverage to keep you company.

The line will move slowly, because you'll pass through a legit security shakedown at the door.  Once inside, moving about is relatively efficient.  If you want pre-show cocktails or snacks, you'll have to wait in line (for us it took a good 20 minutes to get drinks).
  
We had seats on the floor level, which require a secondary ticket screening by security personnel.  Be aware, each time you move out and back into your section (for breaks or to pick up drinks), security will ask to examine your ticket.  I imagine if you lose your ticket along the way, it may become an issue.  I recommend taking a cell phone picture of your ticket, just in case.

The layout of the arena was as expected, nice and new.  If I went there again, I'd select a seat on the second level.  The floor level seats are fine, but in our case, once the band began to play everyone stood up in unison.  So, unless you want to be on your feet for the entire show (and possibly looking at the back of someone's blockhead) examine the elevated seating options.  The food and beverages were basic concert fare.  I didn't see any sexy options in this category.
 
As for the show, Roger Waters puts on an entertaining and visually stimulating show.  I would certainly see him play again.  My wife had seen Pink Floyd play back in the day, and she thought (absent the requisite stoner haze of yesteryear) his current performance hit the mark.",33,Sdai6ywiZCa7q46ghuoVYQ

I said yes and asked a question about a menu item I did not see in the menu that had been recommended.  I looked up and he was gone however.  He returned and... did the same thing again.  Only this time,he took the beer bottle out of my hbd first and set it behind the register. We were baffled.  So rude and inconsiderate to just walk away both times.  We weren't dallying.

2. We sat and received a piece of cheesecake and one entree.  I flagged down a runner, then another to ask if they knew we still had a salad coming.  They brought me a salad, lay it in front of me and I asked if it was the melon salad.  I was told it was Caesar ?!  He took it and ran around the restaurant a few more times with it.  Five minutes later another runner said are you waiting on a salad? And laid down the very same salad in front of me.  I don't know whose it was but it visited several tables b4 u got it.  I told them I was waiting on the melon salad. He beer was gone, my friend had eaten his meal, the cheesecake was melting and covered in flies. Finally, after another 10 minutes went by and the cheesecake was inedible. I received my salad.
3. This was not a good salad. I don't know if they rushed it.  I don't know how many people had touched or become acquainted with it, or if it had originally had some feta or flavor that someone ate.  It was watermelon, tomato and cucumber with fresh ( but not at all flavor-filled) oregano and a sprinkle of feta with a weak balsamic on top.  The predominant flavor was cucumber.  Is that even a flavor? .  It looked pretty though.  It came with a mass of gyro meat.  That was tasty.

And as I was on an empty stomach after making the long road trip into Las Vegas, this is where my lady and I ended up stopping for lunch (on the afternoon of Fri 9/29/17) prior to checking into our hotel room. I know that we don't need yet another fast food chicken place. There's KFC.. There's Popeye's.. There's Chick-fil-A. So how does ""PDQ"" measure up to the big boys of chicken? Well let's just find out.

Located directly on the corner of W. Sahara Ave. & Richfield Blvd. in the Westside neighborhood of Las Vegas, this located has been serving up their delicious chicken ever since 2015. Since I have never stepped foot into one of their restaurants, I had no idea of taste, quality, and service. Fortunately, the respectable amount of Yelp reviews gave me more than enough reason that this would be a quick and inexpensive place to dine.

The inside of this place is very bright, lively, and cheerful. And the employees were super friendly as they said ""Welcome to PDQ!"" as soon as my lady and I walked in. What I particularly loved was that it was extremely clean and spacious. There was an abundance of seating throughout. There is no outdoor seating though. But they do have a drive-thru just in case you wish to take your food to-go.

Their menu is rather extensive as they carry chicken & nuggets (all by themselves), salads, sandwiches, bowls, and shakes. And what does make them special is that they offer a total of 8 homemade sauces. Its very similar to Chick-fil-A in that sense but since PDQ has far less locations nationwide, perhaps their food is of better quality. The good news is that they never freeze their chicken while never adding any hormones and steroids.

As I really was curious to how their chicken batter way, I ended up ordering their ""Crispy Chicken Sandwich"". This was a hand-breaded chicken breast complete with mayonnaise, lettuce, tomato and Grillo's pickles. I also opted for a side of their cool fresh Blueberry Coleslaw. And to drink, I tried one of their freshly squeezed lemonades. Total price for this entire meal, only about $9. My lady ordered the same thing as myself but with French fries as her side.

As far as the time it took for our food to arrive, my lady's meal came out very quickly, within 3 minutes actually. Mine, on the other hand took about 15 minutes. The cashier who rung me up was very apologetic since my meal was taking so long and she gave me a coupon for a FREE sandwich for a future visit. The only problem is that I live nearly 600 miles away from here! So that option would be a little difficult unless I visit Las Vegas in the very near future.

As far as my sandwich, the chicken was flavored and seasoned very well. The only drawback is that it was a bit on the salty side. No big deal because everything else including the toasted bun was delicious. I also liked the blueberry cole slaw as that was delicious and actually a little bit tastier than what you'd find at KFC. Overall, ""PDQ"" is a fairly decent place that is a good alternative to the more well known fast food places. My review, a solid four-stars.",2,yFb-Hqr8k6uIfwCQ3BO4dQ

The clerk was snotty.  At first he wasn't going to exchange them, even though I had the receipt from literally 2 days ago, because I didn't have the box they came in.

We also had the green papaya salad with home made jerky and the steamed dumplings with shrimp, and leek for starters. I wish both dishes were a little bit spicier, the dumplings were nice, but I couldn't quite well taste the leek and shrimp, may be the peanut butter sauce dominated the overall taste. The mains were merely disappointing, I like the curry creamy, unfortunately the green curry with galanga and eggplant was not exactly what I have imagined, may be I did not like very much the fried tofu in the vegetarian choice.

L'Unita was offering a taste of the Basilicata region of Italy and we were looking forward to having our taste buds tickled for the evening.

L'Unita is a great place situated along the border of The Annex and Yorkville neighbourhoods. The restaurant is long and narrow with a large bar for seating. The atmosphere is romantic and intimate during the evening.  The rustic light bulbs hanging above and providing illumination on the delicious Italian fare in front of you.

The staff at L'Unita are top notch and so friendly that it makes your meal even more enjoyable. They were able to help us choose a wine that would go with the impromptu prix fixe menu of the evening. 

Some of my favourite items from the special menu that night which I believe you can also find on the regular menu is:

The Berkshire pork ragu with roasted garlic was a memorable primi for the evening. The whole dish had that savoury Berkshire pork smell emanating throughout.


The other primi was the calzone. It was golden yellow in colour and had a great crunch sound when you cut into it. The filling was a combination of ricotta, swiss chard, chilies, and tomato sauce. Very home-style and true to the region.


I have a soft spot for lamb so the grilled lamb sirloin was perfect for me. It was done spot on with a medium rare sear. The warm potato and pimentino just complimented the lamb well.

I really enjoyed the evening here overall. All the different elements of a meal just came together seamlessly.",2,ulk3n0JW8tWnQ83C7m8z9A

Anyway, we love Paris, but since this was our 3rd trip to Vegas in 5 months, we tried to keep a tight budget, and since we were staying on the most expensive nights (Fri-Sun) we chose to check out Flamingo.  

We arrived at about 10:30pm on a Friday night, so check in was a little busy. I had requested a standard room, nonsmoking with a king bed, but when we arrived they said that all was available was 2 queens. Now, I am not ok with this, especially since I vacation to Vegas usually for romantic getaways with my honey. I sleepy on a queen bed at home, it is nothing special. In Vegas, I want a king. The hostess was finally able to get us a king in a wheelchair accessible room on the 6th floor. 

The real problem is was when we went to bed (1 am ish). We stay in Vegas a lot and are aware that hotels are not silent, but you could seriously hear everything. You know the noise that iPhones make when you plug them in to charge? It is not a very loud noise, and we could hear it clearly from the next room over. We could also hear every word of EVERY conversation. After waking up to ""oh my god I forgot my toothbrush"" and ""you are 27? You are so much older than me!"" at 6am one morning, I decided to complain. We were then moved to the 14th floor without much trouble, and upon exiting the elevator it was obvious that the 14th floor was in much better shape. The noise level was much better, and the walls were obviously thicker.

The rooms are a fairly decent size and there is plenty of rooms for bags/dressing/doing makeup/etc. I myself am a fan of the fun pink décor. 
I would not recommend the flamingo for a romantic weekend getaway. Try Paris or even the Rio for that. I would recommend it for a friends or family trip, as it is definitely a budget hotel. Not a bad experience, but not the same as some of the great Vegas experiences I have had in the past.

We were going to a show at the Byham and it was one of the first beautiful nights in Pittsburgh this Spring, so basically everywhere downtown was busy. We ended up making reservations on Open Table about 30 minutes before arriving & it looked like we got one of the last reservations because everyone else was being turned away when we arrived. 

I remember having a pleasant experience last time I went, nothing that exactly stood out but the food & service was good. Last night was the same. I love the atmosphere inside of Ten Penny, it has the industrial chic look that is popping up everywhere in Pgh, but it's cool & neat to look at. And since it was nice out, they had all the windows open which I love! Our waitress was very attentive & was also very helpful when we asked questions on the menu. Despite how busy she was, she took the time out to explain the specials & answer the questions we had.

Chris & I actually ended up getting the same meal last night. We both got the salmon entree. It has a molasses glaze & pineapple salsa on top. I honestly LOVED this meal! The salmon was cooked to perfection, the glaze was unique and unlike anything I've ever had & I was obsessed with the pineapple salsa on top. Perfect & light meal! The sides are ""family style"" (but they actually aren't that big), so we shared the whipped mashed potatoes & the asparagus. The mashed potatoes were delicious & the asparagus was pretty good but had butter sauce on top that I wasn't overly excited about.

Overall, Ten Penny is always crowded when I go past, the atmosphere is cool and the food is pretty good. I'm sure it will continue to do well in downtown Pittsburgh. There are a lot of other places I would go over Ten Penny but it's always a great option for a good meal and nice night out.",0,1ZPnQs-tdvbX8ROjtnzcEg

Long story short I ordered to-go and requested the order be done 20 minutes in the future. This caused a big fuss at the restaurant, no one was able to ring me up. They had to call two managers...etc. So the next to-go I asked for the order to be ready ''as soon as possible.'' The computer tells you to pick the food up in 15 minutes. 

When I got to the restaurant Jesus says to me ''Your to-go order is almost ready!'' Great, I said, and sat down. A few minutes later I hear Jesus saying to the cooks ''You didn't make that to-go order?'' He then came around to me and asked me if I placed the order to be ready at 4:36 (this was noon'ish). I said no, I had placed the order to be ready as soon as possible. And I explained what happened before. Needless to say they didn't have my order.

Soon, Athena appears and makes things much worse, basically calling me a liar, and saying that my waiting wasn't a problem. I don't make to-go orders so I can sit in the restaurant another 20 minutes. If Athena KNEW anything about this restaurant, she would know there is a drop down box when you order, with 10 minute increments. It's literally impossible for me to have placed this order to be ready at 4:36. But I still got the blame. 

I wrote corporate to tell them what a sucky employee they have. She basically has no idea of her job, and turns around and blames customers. I think I see why so many Applebee's are closing all over the place. I can spend $30 on lunch and be insulted elsewhere, thanks.",3,XNzChtoNOw706kps82x0Kg

I guess it all depends on what expectations you have prior to the show. I'll admit right now that I am by no means a fan of Criss Angel. What opted me to check this out was the fact that it was a CDS production. Here are a few things to keep in mind:

1) Don't go to this show expecting to be stunned by magic. Like others have stated, the magic isn't anything beyond what everyone has seen in the past (being sawed in half, making doves appear, and disappearing).

2) If you're a fan of modern dance choreography, you should enjoy it. While I'm not an expert of dance or anything to that nature, I do know that Wade Robeson or whatever his name is choreographed the show and did an alright job of it. 

3) Costumes and set design were what I expected from CDS. Intricate and detailed which I thought were visually appealing. I personally liked the darker aesthetic that they went for in this show. 

4) Staff should let people in a little earlier so it's not such a rush getting people into their seats. Also, the whole cell phone is a bit too much for me. No need to have people turn in their cell phones. Just state that no cell phones are allowed and if brought they'll be confiscated. Having a cell phone check-in causes too much of a jam when leaving. 

All-in-all, the experience wasn't painstaking like others have stated. I wouldn't pay full price for it though. If you can't get cheaper tickets, I'd opt for the upper level in the center. I think as long as you're in the middle section you're fine.

Other things to note are:
1)He doesn't sing at the end like others have stated(They must have pulled it).
2) The first 5 minutes or so are deterring and almost felt out of place. It's pretty much 5 minutes of rant about his mindfreak show. 
3) If you watch this show more as a narrative of some sort, it's okay. Don't take what he's saying on stage too literal, i.e. in the beginning he says he's going electrocute himself with 12,000 volts. Anyone who actually thinks that he has actually doing this is a bit gullible. This ""trick"" is simply a way for them to segue into Criss' mind. The show is simply supposed to illustrate what is going on in Criss' head.

I didn't explore too much of it, but it has a nice bar and the outside seating area is really pretty, with multiple levels and waterworks.  When we ate here it was a little chilly still at night, so the heat lamps were appreciated.

Service was a little spotty all night.  We ran dry on water a few times, and it seemed like it took forever for our food to come out.  We had some chips and salsa (mediocre, unfortunately, and not free, doubly unfortunately) to tide us over, but things were definitely not moving quickly.

The main courses, though, were good.  I had the stacked enchiladas, which were so big and different they barely registered as enchiladas.  They had good spice to them, though, and I liked being able to have two different meats going on.  The fried egg was a bit unnecessary, though.  I was hoping for a runny yolk, because I love me some runny yolks, but it didn't have one, and thus didn't add much.

Tanya enjoyed her Tesuque chicken salad.  It did have a surprising amount of spice to it between the veggies and the tasty dressing.  The jalapeno bacon was good, too, but the tortilla crusted chicken was more crust than chicken, which was a bit disappointing.

Our companions had lobster enchiladas, which seemed to be the biggest hit of the night, and crab stuffed poblanos, which were also popular.  I didn't get to try those, so that's just hearsay, but they appear to be safe bets.

Overall, things were mostly good, but there were some little issues that held it back from being a great meal.  I would definitely come back, though.",0,48oLH9Nej6IsNMGwxMpsNg

We arrived on Sunday morning and the weather was dismal, raining and a little windy.  We couldn't really reschedule our golf because we were leaving town the next day - so we toughed through the first 9 holes.   The course was reasonably priced and well-kept.

Weird thing: there was no plastic guard on the front of the golf cart, so with the rain, driving a golf cart was just not that much fun this time unfortunately.

We didn't get to the back 9 as the wind and rain picked up significantly, and it just stopped being enjoyable.  

We ended up at the clubhouse to grab lunch and figure out our refund / raincheck situation.  This was not great to be honest  (and why it  lost an additional star) .    The service at the clubhouse was great - food was ok, but the bartender was fun and talkative.

Back to the pro-shop: We were offered a $60 merchandise credit at their proshop, unfortunately, they had nothing which would fit me save the hats (ie. nothing sized medium).

I say that because I had tried several times to come here, but they were closed whenever I'd think of them or they don't answer their phones when I've called to expedite service. So I hopped in the car & drove on over alone. Coming from North Las Vegas down Lamb to this side of town is a drastic change in environment. For Chicago people let me describe this as coming from Oak Brook to the worst Chicago project ever. I saw drug transactions, several prostitutes w/ass hanging out their dresses. It was a very LIT environment.  I'm from the hood, never above the hood, but just be aware!

The environment clearly doesn't deter patrons, at 130ish the place was still jumping with new and old customers. I browsed the menu and decided on 20pc wing lemon pepper & flaming hot, 2pc chicken snack, & a side order of gizzards. YES, IT WAS ALL MINE! Hell I wanted to try it all just in case I never come back, lol. After a 20min wait my order was ready, the lady shows you your order to confirm accuracy, so when looking at mine I don't see my flaming hot wings. I don't recall if she rang them up or not and after the hunger pains & long ass wait I don't inquire I grab my shit & go! 

Driving back down Lamb I'm eating omw too and I started w/the gizzards. Very fresh & hot! I didn't like the seasoning they added to them. I would've preferred none or lemon pepper, so those got disgarded quickly. Next I hit the lemon pepper wings FRIED TOO HARD! Taste was very good, but they should've been pulled up sooner. I saved the last 2pc chicken snack which was a thigh & leg for last. It was extra fresh & juicy, but again that seasoning from the gizzards was present. It's like a chipotle seasoning that's gross to me. So I ate the thigh, but nothing else. I left the rest for my kids who didn't eat any of it. Lol I would return for the flavored wings only.

I feel its important to share a friendly disclaimer for new folks who may come to shop at this location for the first time. Man, this Whole Foods has really turned into a battle zone.

Good for the business to have TONS of customers. However, this inevitably reduces the customer experience. The parking lot is rough. You'll get flipped the bird, aggressively cut off and honked at several times. Be reallyyyy careful in the parking lot. I imagine accidents happen here often. If you're coming on a weekend, its nearly impossible to just peruse and take in the inventory or read ingredients in the store. People are crammed into the tight aisles with not a lot of room to move around. Make a list and soldier in with clear purpose.

5 stars to the incredible staff that are somehow always so cool, calm, collected and helpful. Big kudos to this location for being clean and organized. In addition, they have everything you need and any food for any diet. Just know what you're getting into beforehand and suit up your superhero supermarket armor!",10,u3ZPMVVEzneq8x856WksJQ

Only reason I gave this restaurant two stars is because of the restraunt itself.  It's nice and clean inside and the satff is decently friendly. That's the good, now the bad.

I stuck with my usual for a new Thai restaurant, Pad Thai and wonton soup.  I got the lunch option so had no choice in meat and it came with chicken and one lone shrimp.  The Pad Thai was super saucy though it was decently flavored. However due to the amount of sauce it was not enjoyable. And the wonton  soup was so salty I think they used sea water to cook it.

Baristas were friendly and helpful but seemed slightly annoyed when I asked them a question about their menu. They then took on the attitude that they knew more about coffee than I do. They don't. However the masked friendly customer service did continue until the end. You can tell they use a better quality coffee than some of the chain places but it's a total waste when you pair it with the cheapest flavor syrup that you can. In the end the price is way too high when you're peddling Monin syrup. I will continue my search for decent coffee in AZ.

4m_hApwQ054v3ue_OxFmGw,47,2017-09-28 16:06:38,27,msFtWUrwFFajI67aOKmUrw,"Just after my trip to Barcelona and experiencing the great Spanish food, I had to see if I could find a place in Toronto that could match a bit of the amazing tastes I had.  I will say that Patria has the atmosphere done right with it's beautiful modern dining room that is rich in textures and monochromatic steel greys.  It just allows a nice canvas to let the food pop out and some of it is quite good.

Reservations are not always necessary but its easily done via opentable.  I grabbed an early table and though they do have a shaded patio in one of the larger alley ways, the crazy Toronto heatwave had me begging to stay in AC.  The tables are nicely spaced out with a lounge like area near the bar and a more formal dining seating area closer to the kitchen.  I love the fact the have a 2nd story alcove meant for a larger private party.  We saw a wine tasting dinner going on up there and think its would be a great spot.  I would say that this is a great spot for a date night.  Though the fellow patrons was a mixture of a demure group for a bridal party, several Kardashian-lite groups, and some people walking in California surfer beach attire (lose tank tops, baggy shorts, unkempt wavy hair, and flip flops... this was the girls. Explaining the guys is a novel itself).  I would have expected more of an upscale experience but to each their own to enjoy good Spanish food.

The menu was easily explained as tapas by our friendly server.  We noticed there was definitely two teams working the tables really well together. The servers who took orders and mostly did the food delivery but a very smooth and fun set of secondary servers who worked the entire room to deliver food and take care of any small items (water refills, new plates, serving paella, additional mixing of plated dishes...).

Jamon croquettes - Patria did a good take on these traditional tapas dish.  It was hot with a nice crispy exterior and the creamy interior being the way to bring the rich flavour of the jamon ham to your tongue.  4/5

Wagyu meatballs (Albondigas) - A solid take on meatballs as they were tender and not dry.  The manchego cheese and tomato sauce was needed to give it an added flavour but could have used a bit more. 3.5/5

Bacon wrapped dates (Datiles) - This was a really good dish.  I first had this dish in Chicago and it was mind blowing.  Every time I see it on the menu, I order it.  This is a good dish with the sweet and savoury being fairly balanced.  The salty crisped up bacon wrapped up the sweet gooey dates that holds the melted manchego cheese.  Whats not to love.  I would have liked it if it had a bit of spicy chorizo added inside the dates (thats what I had in Chicago).  4/5

Empanadas - These are quite pretty and another solid dish coming out of the kitchen.  The tender meat was plentiful inside a nice crust that was baked really well.  4/5

Seafood Paella (Paella Patria) - On my trip, I had super terrible and phenomenally amazing paella. Kudos to Patria for not skipping the seafood in the paella.  I would say that this isnt a traditional take or flavour of the Catalonian seafood paella I had.  It is a nice dish though.  It was missing some of the spices and the well known crispy rice crust that gives the paella a wonderful burst of texture and flavour in each bite.  3.5/5

Patatas Bravas - Crispy cubes of potato that are drenched in a bright tomato and molten egg yolk sauce.  For a side, this was quite enjoyable.  I got it for a filler but found myself going back to this more than I planned.  4/5

I have to admit that I was super worried that we would not have enough to eat and it was pricey from the other reviews.  I can safely say we left satisfied but not overly full which is right in my mind.  It definitely hits a bit higher on the price point but no where ridiculous did you sign off your first born.  I would say the service, tastes, and atmosphere does make it a worthwhile stop for any date night or first tastes (or second!) into good Spanish food.",39,PGeiszoVusiv0wTHVdWklA

I came here on a Saturday night around 8pm hoping to avoid the dinner rush, but it was still packed, so I recommend making a reservation as early as possible. The restaurant is tucked away on a quiet corner away from the strip, but inside it's bustling with lots of happy guests eating high quality and authentic Thai food served in a classy and modern environment. There are a lot of parking spaces too!

They have quite the extensive menu, and like some other Yelp reviews have mentioned, it really does seem like almost anything you order here is good. I had the $5 Cup of Tom Yum Kai Soup and the $12.95 Pad Thai with Chicken (just felt like trying a classic this time). I ordered the soup at a spice level of 3 out of 10, which is a little less spicy than sriracha, and it came with tenderly cooked chicken, tomatoes, and mushrooms that were soft but had that delightful hint of nuttiness/earthiness. The Pad Thai was some of the best pad thai I've ever had and I had no complaints there.

I'd recommend coming to Lotus of Siam with a group of 4 and getting a large pot of Tom Yum soup, rice on the side, and then sharing a few a la carte orders such as chicken and/or curry dishes. The Stuffed Chicken Wings and Nam Kao Tod appetizers looked good too.

Overall, if you're in in the mood for some good Asian food or specifically to get your Thai food fix, then you can't go wrong with the great service and authentic, delicious food at Lotus of Siam.",1,Zv0fJ2QvjJQKjdS3mTgPAQ

When it changed to Planet Hollywood, I ate here for a family reunion dinner and it was decent, it was better back then.  So, we tried it out once more during our most recent adventure to Vegas.

First off, $27.99 per adult for dinner, on a Monday?  That's Redonkulous with a capital ""R.""  Thankfully, I'm not complaining much because I got a BOGO coupon so technically, for the s/o and I, it was only $14 each.

The buffet offerings were just okay.  Sure, they had crab salad and shrimp cocktail served in martini glasses but don't be fooled by it, it's not better quality, it's called perception.  They also had the usual Asian, Italian, American, Mediterranean and Seafood fare.  BTW, is it just me or do my fellow Asians act like savages when it comes to Crab Legs?  It's not like it's going to run out people, there's more where it came from, geez!  The salad bar, which was separated in opposite ends of the buffet had to be the sorriest salad bar I've ever experienced, even my hometown pizza parlor offers more salad toppings than this buffet!  But in the end, how can you be mad when they serve up fresh Cotton Candy?  Thankfully they put it high enough so the kiddies don't snatch it all up or get their cooties all over them. :)

Overall, if I had paid full price, The Spice Market Buffet would've gotten 2-stars, no doubt.  But since I didn't, in my opinion, it was worth 3-stars.

I like a one stop shop, and Butcher's Market gives you just that, in local products. They have everything from beautiful cuts of meat to craft beer, to veggies and pimento cheese. Everything is always fresh and you can tell that they've put thought into their selections. The cuts are the best of the best, but they're happy to tell you what are second and third best - if you're looking for something more in that price range. You can find cheese in the back - I'm back on a pimento cheese kick, and they have Pasta & Provisions products in the freezer! I stop in here on Saturdays for the Farmers' Market outside, and then stop inside and pick up my meats (and samples!). They have a very large selection of craft beer for a store of this size, and you'll often find not only food samples, but beer samples as well! I love seeing the hyper local regulars - Bird Song, OMB, Unknown, along with some state wide NC breweries. 

The staff is super helpful and friendly, they'll assist in answering any questions and even tell you how to cook/marinate/smoke/prepare the foods that they sell should you need any guidance (I usually do.). They're always grilling something outside on Saturdays, and this has a very strong potential to change your meal plans. I've come in here a handful of times sure that I was looking for marinated chicken, and walked out with steak instead. haha - who's surprised? No one. 

They are a higher priced butcher, but I feel like it is definitely worth it for one-on-one assistance from staff and the quality of meats and foods that you can purchase here. If you want big box store kind of help, go to a big box store. If you want a little more attention to detail and a larger local selection, go to Butcher's Market.",7,QLgFEumhrHq6LgbEOKCzdw

From the much-hyped cinnamon roll to the made-to-order crepes and galettes, CB caters to those who eat with their eyes first ...and/or post their food on social media.

SAVORY: The ham and cheese croissant is a treasure, and one I've happily shared with a couple of friends. The salmon and broccoli quiche is a favorite to take and bake at home for later consumption with a salad. The galettes are perfectly cooked and I prefer the mushroom-goat cheese over the salmon-veggie version. 

SWEET: Their tarts are beautiful, but the lemon ones are especially tart so it went unfinished at our table. The chocolate chip cookies are perfection with melty chips and a perfect just-baked finish! The cinnamon roll is a take on your traditional flavors but with different ratio of crunchy and spongy bits. 

The quality is quickly evident on a visit, but there are a few areas upon which I hope to see improvement as they settle in: the dine-in service can at times be forgetful, but they're wonderful at following up once they're aware of an issue and the interior is a bit plain and cold but they seem to be adding to it bit by bit. I also wish their coffee was a bit better, as I've found it weak on more than one visit.

You know, dumplings, goulash, schnitzel, the works. I had heard good things about Liba's as a great, no frills option and we were not disappointed. 

I sorta felt like Jerry Seinfeld entering Babu Bhatt's World Cafe as we were the only ones in the place. A little surprising as I had seen a bustling Liba's while driving by a few times. Regardless... we had the attention of the nice lady who was working both the tables and the kitchen. As an app, we shared the Slovakian street food staple smažený sýr (I like alliterations) aka fried cheese. It doesn't sound super healthy - and it's not - but boy is it good with a cold beer (0.5 l Krombacher on tap for $6.50!) to wash it down. For the mains, the gf had fried sole with hand-cut fries. The fish was good but the fries and the dill sauce stole the show. I had the goulash with dumplings and was not disappointed. The goulash meat was nice and tender and the spicing was perfect. The dumplings were just ok - perhaps if we went on a busier night, they would've been made ""more fresh.""

We did not have the schnitzel - which other yelp reviewers have raved about - so we definitely have a reason to go back!

Final rating: 3.5/5 but I'll round up to 4.
Would I go again?: Yes, and i'll have the schnitzel next time for sure... extra dill sauce please!

We were initially seated by a young child. No. Wait. We picked our own table. We selected the one booth with the fewest stains on the table cloth. She brought us our beverages with one ice cube each. Yup. ONE. They say they offer Coke products, but it tasted like Diet Rite out of a 2-liter that had been opened first thing in the day.

15 minutes later, she finally swung back around to take our order. Oh, there was only one other active table in the place, mind you. Over FORTY-FIVE minutes passed before we were finally served our entrees. This gave us plenty of time to look around the restaurant. Box tape was holding up decorations. A disco ball was the focal point of some streamers around the room. The TV was far too loud, but we probably should be grateful as it made it easy to keep our unflattering comments contained to our table. I refused to use the restroom there.

Finally our meal arrived. The Chicken Karahi was nothing but a SMALL bowl of chicken breast swimming in Frank's Hot Sauce. Seriously. It was Frank's brand. I'd had it not more than 2 days prior. The other entree was the Mixed Tandoori Combo Delux. Everything was dry and impossible to enjoy -- except the sauteed onions. Those were good.

We were not offered refills of our near-flat Diet Rites at any point. Not after the starters were gone. Not after the glasses were empty. Not during the meal -- even after an ADULT server brought the entrees and blinked at our empty glasses. Were we not even checked on to see if we needed anything or had any concerns about the food. So finally, after sitting with empty plates in front of us for THIRTY minutes (far longer than it took us to eat it), we were almost hungry again. But more importantly we wanted our check so we could go get something to drink. No one was in sight. Not a cook. Not a server. Not a child. No one. So I called the restaurant from the table. They refused to answer the phone. Finally, a woman with a bluetooth headset peeked around the screen from the kitchen, looked me square in the eye, saw me wave to get her attention -- and promptly turned around never to be seen again.

Never have I dine-and-dashed -- but I was highly tempted to that evening. Eventually, a child came around and I asked for our check. Finally! Some acknowledgement -- or so I thought. The chef (possible owner/owner's wife) came around to discuss an issue with another (the ONLY OTHER) table and I attempted to get her attention to tell he we were ready for the check and had a Groupon. We were ignored.

It finally took the child TEN MORE MINUTES to deliver our check to the table. When we pointed out the groupon, she wanted to take the phone with her. We didn't allow that to happen (an iPhone is probably the most expensive thing that establishment has ever seen). After telling her how to credit the value of the Groupon against this check (because WE had to explain the weird terms and conditions the restaurant put on the Groupon), we finally just let her credit the 'value' of the Groupon against the check (Which did not work out in the restaurant's favor) so we could get the hell out.

My message to the hungry public: Do not eat here. This restaurant is doomed and can not be saved. It's in a shady part of town, the service is HORRIBLE, the pricing is out of line with portion size and quality.

My message to the owners: Stop. Save what money and credit you have left and close your doors. Your chef can seem to only cook one dish at a time. This is what caused our excessive wait time; and a mysterious phone order caused an excessive delay on the preparation of the meal for another table of four. There is no possible way your staff or restaurant's infrastructure can support a full house -- which is exactly what you need to survive. But it's not going to happen.

If you're hanging around Henderson and looking for a casual, appe-THAI-zing place to grab lunch, Gata Thai is a good option to THAI on for size. Don't worry, the puns stop here.

Their lunch special is from 11a-3p and a steal at $6.95. Included items: soup, salad, egg roll, and steamed rice (except on noodle dishes). I was sad to see no pad see ew is offered as a lunch special, so I went with pad thai. Honestly, it was a little too sweet for me. The service was friendly though and decor was just enough for a pleasant vibe, so I'll come back to try another dish.

Bonus: Free thai iced tea with yelp check-in!
Another bonus: 10% off if you pay with cash.

Would give it another try, but not get the seafood platter.  Too expensive and poor quality.  I knew there was trouble when they handed it to a manager and told him it was overcooked, and his response was ""Again?""

Overall, the problem was with the process.  I liked my salesperson.  Everyone was friendly enough and I have at least some hopes for the service department; however, for a luxury car dealership, the process lacked luxury for sure.  

I went on a whim on a Saturday and test drove one vehicle.  That went fine and was reasonably efficient.  I then wanted to see a more upgraded model before deciding.  That took over an hour, since as a city dealership, they have to go get the car.  The car ran out of gas on the way, so there was that delay as well.  I looked and left, asking the salesperson to provide pricing via e-mail because I was out of time by the time they got the car there.   

There were some wires crossed in the communication, but we eventually all got on the same page and I made an appointment at 9am the following Saturday to show them my trade and complete a cash purchase.  I had already shown my tendency toward impatience on the previous visit.  And I very clearly stated that I didn't want to be there all morning when I made the appointment, so I was hoping that they'd have everything ready except for my trade value.  Not so much.  

The trade evaluation was quick, but then the inefficiency really started.  They didn't have the pricing ready, so there was a wait there.  Then the finance guy was needed (no loan, but he also does title work and the warranty sales spiel ).  He had not a thing prepared either, so I had to wait for him.  Then to the cashier, who had to call and verify my check and issue a receipt - more waiting.  The tech guy who explained all the buttons was next - had to wait for him too.  His spiel needed a little work, but it was good enough.  Then the car needed gassed - again, another wait. 

All told, an efficient process could have easily taken under an hour.  This took over two and a half and that was with me quite impatiently skipping pieces and trying to push it along.  The problem is that their whole process is linear - you are passed from one person to the next with a lot of waiting in between.  Why they can't gas up the car while I am doing the paperwork is beyond me.  Why the tech guy couldn't have done his thing in the 45 minutes I spent waiting for the finance guy is also beyond me.  Why the cashier couldn't have worked on my check while I was doing title work...you get the idea.   

I am sure that people generally spend a ton more time buying a car and perhaps that is normal, but I made an appointment specifically to avoid all of that.  If they are truly serving the luxury market, they need to coordinate the buying process better.",6,h9LPugJk2cpIh0gmQb5LnQ

Overall a disappointing experience. This place earns a 2 1/2 stars in my book, but I am giving them 2 stars based on the rating scale. 

We had reservations at 8P since that was the earliest they could accommodate our party of 6 on a Saturday night. (we made reservations 2 days out) We arrived at 7:45P and were advised to return at 8P as our table was not available yet. Not a problem, interesting that they did not invite us to wait in the bar area. However, the bar seemed crowded with diners as well. We returned at 8P and were seated within 5 minutes. Although we placed our orders within 10 minutes of being seated, our dinners were not served until 9:15 P. 

First the positive stuff......dinners are served with a house salad and two sides. The BBQ Bourbon Rib Eye steak was excellent. Cooked to perfection, tender and flavorful. Prime Rib was served medium rare as requested. Mashed potatoes were made from real potatoes and not the instant stuff. 

Now for the negative.....Our waiter spent the better part of the evening attending to another table across way so it was near impossible to get his attention. Luckily, the assistant waiter was attentive and kept our water glasses filled and handle any requests that we had. I ordered the lobster since it was recommended in several reviews. Unfortunately, I thought it was on the tough side. (maybe it was overcooked?!?) In addition, it was barely lukewarm when served. Since it had taken so long for our dinner to arrive, I was afraid if I sent it back, I may never get anything to eat. In my past experience, the waiter usually removes the lobster tail from the shell ~ not in this case. Once our dinner was served, I don't recall seeing our waiter until dessert time. I tasted a piece of my friend's prime rib. Although it was served medium rare as requested, the meat was barely lukewarm at best and not that tender. The meat had no flavor, I had to add salt and pepper.

The event rooms are incredibly amazing, if I lived in Cleveland I would try to find an excuse to use them. Our room was clean and well prepared. The interior decorating is modern in style, which is fine, but poorly executed. For example there is no actual door in the suites between rooms. This is a problem when the whole reason you booked a suite was so that the baby could sleep undisturbed in the other room. beyond that, lots of weird choices: the couch requires that you recline at 45 degrees which is very awkward, the trashcans are about one liter in size, the water doesn't stay in the sink, the fancy faucets are difficult to turn on/off one-handed, etc. Looks very nice and I really appreciate the bare floors.

She just kept saying ""it will even with next coat"" and I explained to her that it was the base coat and she ignored me . I was there for over 2 hours and I left completely livid . My tech was the only person who was there when I left so I couldn't even ask to have it fixed or re-done by someone else.

The bowling alley is down there and open. Good luck getting a lane as apparently they get reserved quickly. As we sat down we were soon greeted by a waitress which was nice. The unfortunate part of the basement is that it has a totally different food and drink menu from upstairs and you could not order anything that was not on that menu (ie: a bigger selection from upstairs). this was disappointing since the food on the menu is more like snacking food.

I've had stellar service for my oil changes in the past but my experience was atrocious and absolutely unprofessional at best.

First of all, they've changed the interior service area with these high counters which is a change from their desks they used to have. The usual crew that I normally see on weekdays were not there. 

I had to ask whom I can speak with when I got in. And there was one person behind this high desk on a busy Saturday. He was unapproachable and just rude.

The worst part is when I went to pick up my car. I go in confused as to whom I need to speak with for the payment. I find some girl behind a little desk with her half eaten sandwich in full view in front of her and myself and ask if that's where I pay. 

She casually said yes and rang me up to pay. No explanation of what they had done, no going through the multiple things they did to my car, and no updates on my car's condition. 

I had to ask the girl, ""Do you know when I need to change my battery or how my car is doing?"" Apparently the 30k mike service includes my battery condition. The girl just shrugged her shoulders and said she wouldn't know. I asked that I speak to someone about my car that can answer my question. If I'm spending 8 times the amount of money than I normally do, I'd like someone to give me an update, not be rushed to make a payment and leave. 

The girl pages the supervisor who comes around and tells me, ""Some cars need a new battery within a few months and some don't it all depends.""

WOW. I'd imagine they could tell me if it was at 50% capacity or 70% if they're checking my battery levels as part of the service check. 

The supervisor walks away. After I pay she asked, ""Did you see your car it front?"" I said, ""No."" Then she tells me, ""You can walk around to the side and keep walking to look for your car. If you don't see it, then let us know."" And hands me my keys. 

MY CAR WAS IN THE WAY BACK BEHIND THE BUILDING where there are NO customers at the back of the shop. And it was parallel parked in with 6 other cars in a line. I was struggling to get my car out of this tight area all the while thinking, ""Am I an employee or a customer?"" 

A guy in uniform saw me and helped me get my car out from this tight space. Imagine the liability if I had scratched up other customer's cars on my way out? What if that was YOUR car that I bumped into? Is there any quality assurance that we are leaving our cars in good hands? How many other customers have had to pull their own car out and perhaps left a mysterious dent or a scratch on my car that I would have NEVER thought came from the dealership?l

I couldn't believe that after spending 8 times the amount of an oil change, I'd have to walk to the back and get my own car from a tight space when they have brought it out front after a simple oil change. Just imagine me clicking my keys incessantly waiting to hear my car beep back as I walked the long stretch to the side and down to the VERY END and back like an imbecile in 110F Vegas heat. 

It's unfortunate that this is the only Subaru dealership in Vegas. I no longer want to get an oil change or any service, let alone a Subaru in the future. I felt demeaned and quite frankly writing this review brings back horrible feelings and gets me very upset. I'm going to have to find an external source for my future services. 

Oh yes, I forgot to add, there's a coffee cart with no one servicing the area on a BUSY Saturday, while I saw couple employees standing BEHIND the cart, enjoying their coffee chatting away. I wasn't sure if they were the ones who were supposed to help or not. But they sure didn't even ask or take a second look.",3,B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw

As soon as we walked in the waitress who sat us was hanging over a table eating french fries from a customers plate. She rudely asked if we were the party of 10 and brought us to our seats. When it came time to order the food the waitress (wish I got her name) was so rude it was unbelievable!! She rolled her eyes and huffed and puffed because it was a little loud and confusing with our big group. I don't care how big and loud we are, you DO NOT roll your eyes and pout like a baby to your customers. While she was picking up the menus she dropped them and said ""god damnit"" right behind us!   When our food came out it was up to us to figure out where the plates needed to go and we were missing an entrée. When we finally waved down the waitress she stated ""well I gave them the order there was just a lot of food"" so we decided to cancel the plate. Five minute later she drops it in front of us and says well the chef made so I wanted to give you the option to eat it. 

That was the last straw, a member from our group found a manager and explained our complete disgust with our waitress. The manager claimed to be shocked and said she was her best waitress. If she is your best waitress then that might explain why your restaurant was dead on a Saturday night.  The manager did comp all of our drinks which was 71$ but still added the 18% gratuity and a service charge. I would have paid for my drinks instead of giving the waitress our money.  


The waitresses are so concerned with catering to the 5 older regulars then the new business that is coming in. The sad part is the food was decent and the music was enjoyable they have so much potential but will not have repeat customers with those waitresses. If it wasn't for having such a big party on a Saturday night, we would have walked out upon arriving.

It wasn't the worst I have ever had but I def. won't be back. I have taken the patient path in life this year so I am able to give 2/5 stars others in the party would give 0/5 I am sure ... Let me explain

We were seated about 15mins after our estimated wait time (not a big deal but we did have plans after) our ""table"" for 7 was complied of two different size tables not a huge deal but one table was so small our party had to cram around it sitting on the corners to have enough room one table had glasses preset the other didn't after examining the cups we realized the table wasn't preset it wasnt fully bussed before we were seated. 

Now onto the service... Our waitress comes over takes our drink orders coffee waters ice teas, brings waters in pitchers no cups then brings cups no ice then brings cups with ice takes away old cups all while we are all holding parts of this fiasco because our tiny table doesn't allow for more then 1 glass per person without total chaos. We all look over the menu for a few and our waitress returns (after sometime) to take our order. That went slowly but smooth enough. Now onto the food.

1/2 our order comes out it take another 5/10 minutes for the rest of our food to come out all delivered by people other then our waitress and it was like we were at an auction everyone just calling out what they had In their hands and us passing each other's food all around. We had to ask twice for the side of hash browns we ordered and enough utensils for everyone at the table. 

My aunt ordered the biscuits and gravy she didn't like the taste and let our server know the gravy tasted ""off"" our waitress said it was turkey gravy (my aunt eats no poultry) she was instantly upset and said now you tell me I can't eat this. There was No apology no acknowledgement of what just happened here by our waitress she simply said ""it's on the menu""  (and just so you know I looked at the menu and it says sausage gravy.) She did remove that item from the ticket but the lack of empathy or responsibility taken by our server or a manager was disappointing, thank god there was no food allergy that could've turned tragic from their oversight.

It was supposed to arrive within 10 business days. It took 15. I told them if it arrived more than 12 days I wouldn't be available until the weekend to meet them at the border as I started a new job and couldn't be at customs between 9-4.

First the positives, I love the space - amazing decor, huge space, awesome outdoor patio, giant beer board, and the parking is really convenient too. The happy hour is a good deal if you stick to beer - often you can score some great releases for $3 or $4 bucks a pour. 

However, there are quite a few negatives as well. About those beer pours, the UB takes the stance that 1-1.5 inches of head is a good pour. Well that might be fine when we're talking about a pint glass here - but when you leave several inches of space on my 10oz snifter, I'm not going to be happy. I've never complained about bad pours, but for one bartender in particular there, it was ridiculous. The other bartender working actually came by and took my glass back and added to it the last time it happened, apologizing for the bad pour, so I know its not just me here. Another thing that bothered me is that the bad-pour bartender also proceeded to have a conversation at the bar within earshot of my group about how he couldnt wait to get off and head downtown to get wasted at Chase Field. Now, I don't know about you, but I would think discussing plans to get hammered in front of customers wouldnt be acceptable in a nice establishment. 

Now, about the food. The happy hour menu is a complete waste of money - I've ordered a couple items from there and all are very undersized for the price - nothing ""happy"" about that! The mac and cheese came out in a tiny tray and when i saw it, I actually started laughing - probably about 5 bites of food for $7 bucks? It was crazy, I sent that back immediately. On 2 other visits, we've tried to order the parmesean garlic fries with our meals - and both times they came out cold and soggy in a tiny tray.

We had a 7 pm reservation, and checked in at 6:55.  We were told it would be a few more minutes but to ""please take a seat at the bar and we'll come find you when you're table is ready.""  So, we head in through the tube-like entrance into a PACKED bar, with no where to sit, and not even anywhere to stand.  We poked around and debated ordering a drink, but decided not to because we thought we'd be seated soon.  So back into the smoky, loud casino we went to wait.  And wait.  Aaaaaand wait.  Not a bench or a chair in sight, we stood and waited for nearly 30 minutes for our table.  Pretty disappointing given we had a reservation.

We were seated and greeted by our server, who presented us with an iPad to look at drinks.  Kinda gimicky, but ok.  We ordered drinks and then he disappeared for a long time, returning with the ""meat trolley.""  Unfortunately we already had looked at the menu while he was gone, and knew what we wanted, but then we had to sit through a 10 minute meat presentation before even ordering a starter.  Now it's almost 8, and we haven't had a bite to eat.  

We ordered the pork belly and sliders to start, which came promptly after a nice bread selection.  The pork belly was very good, but lacked salt, and the sliders were better.  We ordered a signature Wellington to share, and were talked into ordering a side with it, which ended up being WAY too much food.  The Wellington was a bucket list item for me, and I was so excited for it, but it was just ok.  The steak was amazingly tender, but needed more seasoning and the pastry and duxel were borderline flavorless.  For $55 for an 8 oz portion, it was underwhelming at best.  We didn't touch the potato side because with 2 starters, bread, and a Wellington, we were stuffed!  The portions here are pretty hefty, so don't be coerced into ordering more than you need.

My hubby ordered a second beer from our waiter's ""helper"" and when it came he was surprised at how hoppy it was.  He drank it, but when we got the bill it had a completely different beer with ""Hoppy"" in the name instead of what my hubby ordered.  Pretty weak for a fancy place.

The best part of the visit was probably the ambiance, I loved the dining room with the Union Jack ceiling! They managed to make an upscale steakhouse into a ""fun"" environment which was refreshing for sure.  It felt a great balance of casual and fancy.

In all, we're glad we came, but I wish it was better.  The service could use some work, and the food could use some seasoning.  It would be nice to bring bread and/or let guests order starters before presenting the ""meat trolley."" Our bill was $155 for a cocktail, 2 beers, 2 starters, a shared steak and a side dish.  Pretty comparable to most Vegas restaurants, but we still feel like the experience was just ""ok.""",0,jnUECQSItgACyvhyzHXvXw

The first thing that happened when I told the hostess my name was that I was late -- for some reason Fabbrica's system had indicated my reservation was for 12:30pm when I booked it for 1:00pm via OpenTable (which I showed on my phone).  It was extremely odd... never had that happen before with any restaurants that use OpenTable.

Anyway, we got seated near the pizza oven/kitchen and were asked about what menu we wanted and made our selections.  The wait between courses was incredibly, incredibly slow.  It took about 30 minutes between the appetizer and the main, and by that point the waiter who was looking after my table kept looking over... only to see my super bored face looking back at him.  I think they had grouped tables together before informing the kitchen staff to prep the dishes, but it was quite a while to wait for the food...

Food quality is not as good as it was in the past. On my last two visits, I've ordered the same dishes and on each occasion, the only thing consistent was the name. Quality was all over the place.

On our last visit our green beans came out as we were finishing up our meals...to be honest, we thought they had forgotten about them. The time before, the noodle dish we ordered came out a good 10 minutes after the rest of our meal did. It's very odd and not a great way to serve food.

A small and intimate restaurant on the Ossington strip, reservations could be hard to come by and our party of 7 had a strict 2.5 hours reso timeframe to follow. We practically ordered the full menu:

- Smoked mussels ($17): intriguing presentation of their mussels concealed by a cloud of smoke. The smokey taste was interesting but the mussels were too skinny and lacked their sweet juiciness.

- Cured trout over cedar branches ($15): again nice presentation but it ends about there.. The trout was tough and bland and the pieces were tiny.

- Venison and foie gras parfait ($15): if there was one thing I'd recommend it would be this - definitely the best dish we had from the menu. The foie gras parfait was sweet, light, silky and had a meaty savoury tanginess to it. 

- Pan roasted elk ($16): this was very tender with a great sear on them and worth trying as elk is not a regular menu item. 

- Pigeon pie ($24): first time having pigeon pie and I can't say I'm looking forward to the second. Literally just tasted like a regular meat pie.. And at $24 for a small pie it was quite forgettable.

There were some good dishes but nothing jumped out as a show stopper. Overall be prepared for small and dainty dishes that will take many plates (and $$) to fill you up. We also felt like it was a rushed dining experience and we were reminded to stick within our timeframe at various times.

I called to have them come out and honor their warranty but was told by the receptionist, (because Kevin Hanshew refused to take the call), ""I was told to tell you that the warranty was voided because we didn't install the door openers"". Their contract and proposal stated nothing about this ""disclaimer"". They said they would come out to look at it but I had to pay their $95 call out charge and for any repairs. I was so mad I called another company, Dreikosen door co, who was awesome by the way, and as I expected the door wasn't installed properly. The track was 2"" too far out which caused the cable to slip off. (And now a year later it still works great! Go figure!?!?) anyways, I told Kevin I expected reimbursement for the $225 charge to fix their inadequate installation. He refused... And the battle began.

I'm a simple man and usually order pepperoni pizza.  If you order by the slice, the slices are generous.  I've been told the dough and sauce are made there and I believe it because the pie has a unique taste with the crust having a certain sweetness on the end of the taste buds.  Also, the tacos are great and look more like burritos (again a generous helping).
The cons...well the fact that the place is inside of a bar is a con for most people.  For me, it's a pro because it lends itself to some great people watching and if you can't handle a little cigarette smoke (I don't smoke them), then get it to go.",0,q1N3imUYbjrUso_dy4c5gw

Menu has pita sandwiches, plates, and a few specialty dishes like their shakshuka. Unfortunately, a recent change in hours means that you can only get your fix on weekdays before 6PM. Kind of a bummer, hopefully not a harbinger of closure.

FIRST VISIT: Came in to signage hyping their falafel, opted for the wrap. This was rolled up taco style and served with a tasteless tahini. If they included hummus, I couldn't tell because there either wasn't much of it or that too lacked seasoning of any sort. The portion size was large but I prefer the more classic smaller, stuffed pita sandwich as this one didn't hold up well and resulted in a mess. Falafel was pretty good though, nicely crisp on the outside with a soft interior. Adding options for a spicy sauce, red cabbage, and pickled veggies would make this really pop.

I saved this as a draft and planned to return for their shakshuka for my second visit before posting a review. unfortunately, the business closed before I could make the weekday only hours fit my schedule.

It's definitely not the British way of spelling the word either..  You're an artist of the grain, not the spoken word! ;)

And why is the ""GR"" capitalized?  Is it an homage to Chef Ramsay's infamous bear-like growls at his employees?  

Anyways...

The menu shows the prices on the left side for ""non-rewards members,"" and the right side was for ""rewards members.""  Why such blatant cross-marketing?

The Earth Burger was...Earthly.  The grilled portobello mushroom tasted like a grilled portobello mushroom.  For non-meat options, the goal is to disguise the taste of it right?  Mission not accomplished.

My friend and I also ordered the Truffle Parmesan Fries.  One ""first world complaint/spoiled people problems"" I have is that the way the truffle fries is served, it's displayed so that it's easier for one person to eat by themselves rather than for two to share.  Sharing is caring?

The fries were also kind of greasy, especially by the time you get to the bottom.  They were also varied in shape, so they weren't really uniform in terms of softness/mushiness/oiliness.

You see, my father died as a result of the blunt force trauma he received at Sante, the very night he was brought there and I told them he was a fall risk and needed to be in direct sight and restrained if necessary. Neither of these things happened. He suffered a cracked skull and blunt force trauma. He was sent to the hospital where I was called (Sante did not contact me at all). He was medical helicopter'd to St. Joseph's in Phoenix. He never stood a chance. All of this could have been prevented and Sante of Mesa failed to do this.

My view is, if you are capable of speaking up for yourself and taking care of yourself such as needing rehab for a surgery, then this place may be great for you. However if your loved one is not capable of this, is weak or needs help in movement, stay far away from here. It's taken me this long to even respond. I hate what my father went through, the pain he suffered, because of not following a simple request. I've missed my dad at every holiday, every family event. I have missed him every single day for over 2 years and still feel like I am grieving. My only hope is Sante of Mesa reads this, FEELS this, and makes significant changes to the procedures.

On top of that, there was barely any pistachio on the lamb! I was hoping dessert would save the day (how hard can it be to mess up gelato?) but Toula has managed to destroy the last dish as well. The gelato they served would make any Italian ashamed. The flavors tasted fake and sugary... I only had one taste of each flavor and dropped my spoon.

So I used them to install new St Augustine sod and they did a quick, clean, and nice job -- not cheap, but at a fair price.  This morning a main drip line sprung a leak under my driveway where it crosses under the driveway to get to the other side where more shrubs are.  I figured out the problem and diagnosed the issue, but I was too lazy to dig up the conduit ends where the drip line runs thru.  So I call PLS and they came within a couple of hours; dug up the conduit; replaced BOTH drip lines running thru the conduit and covered everything back up neatly and cleanly.

There is a comfy sectional couch with a single pull out bed, a tv in the bathroom and many other amenities. 

The elevators are really fast.

My biggest complaint is that when we ordered towels, a blanket and extra pillows, it took 1.5 hrs to receive, which was so long that even the Priority Card center called in to check on us to make sure we received. What made it worse was that when I called in after 45 minutes of waiting, the housekeeping lady that picked up claimed I only called in 20  minutes ago, but that was actually just the time she decided to put in my order. This made us miss meeting our friends at another casino, which obviously ruined our experience.

I chose this company because of the 5 star Yelp reviews, but unfortunately had a 1 star experience.

I contacted Carolina Appliance Repair almost a week ago to come and look at our refrigerator that was not cooling.  They had someone come the same day which was really nice.  The technician who arrived was polite and seemed knowledgeable.  He immediately popped off the back of the unit and showed me what happened.  Our compressor was very dirty and because we didn't catch it in time, he believed it had burned up our motor.  

He recommended our best bet was to probably get a new refrigerator, but since we have a home warranty that would cover a compressor, he told me that he would get his boss to find out how much it would cost to have it repaired to see if it was more cost effective to repair or replace.  He tried to call his boss while at the house, but was unable to reach him.  He assured me he could get a quote for me and someone would call from the office within a couple of days.  They charged $89 for this service call.

After the check was cashed and I had not heard anything in about a week, I called to find out what was going on.  I spoke with Bob, who appeared to be the owner or manager.  He was very short with me on the phone and would hardly let me explain what was going on.  He first said they never serviced me, then after I told him that they cashed our check, so they must have come out, then he asked a couple more questions, told me that he had no record of our service call and would have to call me back.

He called back a few minutes later to tell me that he doesn't have anyone to repair compressors right now and they wouldn't be able to help us.  I told  him that $89 was a very high price to pay for a service call for them to not follow up like they promised and there seemed to be a lot of miscommunication between him and his technician.  He half apologized and that was it.  I really feel like they should have partially refunded the service call fee since they didn't finish servicing us in a timely manner.  That would have been good customer service, and what I expect from supporting a small business.

As much as I like to support small businesses, I just can't honestly recommend this company.  I used Yelp reviews to choose them to contact, so I just want to be fair to others who may do the same in the future by giving an honest review.",10,cOkZ3RYWHmnLXOWdT97iCA

Twice I've been impressed with the level of service, attention to details and the quality of the food and drink.

For starters, the sampler beer or wine at the door while we wait for our table is really the best way to start any dinner. Then the drinks, anything with slush and Jack Daniels is my new fave! Also discovered a lovely white wine that I will definitely get again. The waitress was even nice enough to find out if I can buy the wine at the LCBO (bonus, I can!)

Then there is the delicious food. I've been here twice and both times I ordered a salad and each time had a special request and they were more than accommodating. The first time a friend and I planned on splitting the salad, and they did it for us, which was very helpful. 

Second time my chicken looked a bit pinky for my taste (the chicken was so juicy, but I was still cautious). The waitress noticed and immediately offered to redo it for me. She brought over the rest of the salad to eat while I waited for my chicken, and it was perfect the 2nd time around! The manager even came to check up on me which was a nice gesture.

The Salads themselves are quite awesome, and I'm not a huge herbivore! The Lemon-Caper dressing on the Ceaser was so good that I joked I wanted to wear it as a face mask!

While it is a bit pricier, its worth it just for the high quality of service and food you get.

I ordered the double beef slider with a side of chicken rings.  I was looking forward to my meal since they make the food by the order. But by the time I sat down right after picking up my order, the buns were already soggy and sticking to the cardboard box.   The burger tasted fresh but I was disappointed with my soggy buns.   For the price of $2.59 for 1 small double cheeseburger slider, it was not worth it.  I could get a better double cheeseburger that's bigger, cheaper, and more tasty.   The chicken rings was more batter than chicken. For 6 pieces, they charge $3.99 which is much more than at Mc Donald.  I could order 20 pieces for $5 at Mc Donald.

Which we made sure the server and restaurant knew about, nothing above and beyond or even ""special"" was done or offered.  (Except a little confetti on the table)

Things started with being handed a huge wine list on a tablet with no guidance - then no personal assist from the sommelier, just the server asking them a brief question for us.  

Excessively seasoned (fire hot), appetizer.  Almost inedible for a few of us at the table.  I suspect the use of a complementary voucher to be the culprit for that. 

Then being served the wrong steaks and having to switch them ourselves at the table.   Once the steaks were settled, they seemed very well prepared and were enjoyed. 

Onward to addressing one of the party members by the wrong gender.  Apologizing of course, but still uncomfortable. 

Another of our party ordered the pan seared tuna - it was the worst cut of tuna possible.  Stringy, difficult to bite and without being given a steak knife it was almost impossible to cut. (The meal was not sent back because of the occasion and not wanting to make a fuss)

We ended our meal with burnt coffee and what turned out to be delicious desserts. 

The price, the occasion and the fact we went for dinner, not lunch, added up to the assumption that this would be a wonderful evening.  It turned out mostly mediocre.

Harvey's is actually like the Subway of burgers--you get to build your burger as much as you'd like with toppings.

The movie watching experience here just lacks something, but it makes up for it by having all their cinemas in digital quality, I enjoy the popcorn here (but lack of shakers is a downer for me), I wish they had a bit more range when it comes to the concession stand, it IS in the heart of the city. 

The system is a little unusual with the box office located 3 stories below the theatre, with automated machines at both locations. And as someone that comes here around twice a week, I am more familiar with their loyalty program than most people that work the box office, which is a little frustrating having to explain their own system to them, but the staff at the customer desk are always very friendly.

The midnight release experience here is clearly inferior to that at Scotiabank as they cannot accommodate large lines inside, and had people lining up in the food court for the Harry Potter release, it was the same for tiff, rush lines would be in the food courts and it gets confusing very fast. 

The IMAX experience at first glance seems less impressive than what I'm used to, but after a few trips to both this and the Scotia one, I'm coming to realise the disparity is not as large. 

Their ETX seems larger than the Scotiabank Ultra experience, but the lack of seat assignments makes this lose out on that front. 

If you watch a movie (even if it's once a month or so) it makes so much sense to sign up for their loyalty program which trumps the scene due to the reduced ticket prices, although the rewards come in smaller portions than Scene's, but AMC provides free popcorn via emailed coupons every Monday - Thursday if you pay attention to their emails. 

But this is a massive complex, their movie options are questionable at times (having 3 Indian movies playing in the same time period for e.g.) but it does deliver on the quality front which is enough for me.",5,9W73B44Iw8WslrTNB2CdCg

You may step into the food court and Pan Asian Express may catch your eye. ""Wow, I could really go for some Chinese food,"" you think to yourself. The name might even remind you of something similar, say...Panda Express?

Well, if you've gotten that far, then S-T-O-P. Take a step back. And go to McDonald's instead.

This establishment is NOT worth your time, stomach space, nor money. You are paying for tiny portions of poor quality food. And while I wouldn't expect food court quality to be the greatest nor Vegas prices to be the cheapest.. this was just disappointing on a whole new level.

A single entree, single side bowl was nearly $10 and was TINY - maybe barely enough for a child. I got my bowl with mixed vegetables and broccoli and beef, and while it was edible, it was not satisfying in the least. A double entree, single side plate is much more worth the price at $11, but still definitely not worth the purchase at all.

I had been going to Elaine's nails regularly for about a yr and had some surgeries done and couldn't go for a long while. A friend and myself started doing regular pedi's about every 2 weeks together at a different salon. I suggested we go to Elaine cause I really liked them before and they do awesome designs which I don't usually get but I am going on vacation next week and wanted something special. I was told I could go online and find anything I wanted and they could do it. I found a simple glitter fade (gold to look like sand) then wanted a palm tree off to the side of the big toe. I showed the picture of the palm tree I liked and she said no problem. 

So pedi was good, then the painting starts. I got a cream color base with gold glitter fade looked cute, then had to wait for another girl to do the palm tree. She came over and was gonna just do her own thing and I said wait I want a palm tree like this, showed her the detailed pic I found and she barely glanced at it for 1/2 a second then started painting. The palm tree was supposed to be a small accent in black off to the side. She did this one so big with super thick lines and it looked all smudged and absolutely horrible I told her that was not what I was looking for and so the original girl just said we just leave with the glitter it looks better that way. I just shrugged my shoulders and said ok. I was not satisfied with my nails and I know they knew it but did nothing to change or fix it so I would like it. Then when we checked out they charged me an extra $5 for glitter!! Really? I understand paying that for French or a design but really? Glitter polish? Whatever I am so not happy and now have to make another trip to another salon (the previous one my friend and I had been going to) to get a polish change and have to spend more money to do so.

The food: The ($18) surf and turf fries were covered in cheezewiz and overnight grocery store guac, with a stingy amount of ""asada"" and 4-5 shrimps.

The musical ""First Date"" is performed in 90 minutes without interruption. Two people meet for dinner on a blind date. Not only do they find themselves incompatable at the beginning but their date is constantly interrupted by three waiters who take on various characters in their lives. Many of them try to ""bust"" up the relationship in the form of various hilarious songs that had me laughing in stitches!

I've been here four times, hoping that I would find that redeeming quality that would let me write a fantastic review, but sadly, I am writing this one.

I really like Chef Sawyer and everything he is doing for downtown. He is a very visible presence in both of his restaurants, and I love that. It shows me that he cares with what is going on. 

Noodlecat could be perfect. The atmosphere, the location, the wait staff...all are spot on. I wouldn't change that at all. It is the food and especially the prices that hurt this place, and it would be hard to argue that these aren't the most important parts.

As I said, I have been here four times, and each time I had something new:

My first visit was some corn chowder ramen (It is not on the menu anymore), and the steamed pork bun. The presentation was great, and I was super excited to dig in. Unfortunately, the pork bun, and the ramen were both extremely salty. I'm not huge on salt, so I can let that slide a bit, but wow...so much salt. The ramen, although salty, had a rich savory taste that I enjoyed at the beginning, but by the end, it was just too much. I couldn't finish it. It should be noted that my roommate tagged along, and loved every bit of her meal (Fried Chicken Ramen and same Pork Bun).

Given that I wanted to love this place, and my craving for noodle soup, I headed back a week later for a second visit. This time I got the Fried Chicken Ramen. I enjoyed it a lot more than my previous dish, but it was a little flavorless. This time, I wanted more salt. However, it gave me a little confidence that this place could be good. I just needed to give it more time.

On my third visit, I got the special of the day. It was udon noodles in a pork/fish/chicken stock with cashews, brussel sprouts, and bacon. I also treated myself to one of the beers on tap. This was the dish I was waiting for. It was awesome. I loved every bit of it, and I wanted more. Then my bill came...roughly $23 for a bowl of soup and one beer! Jeeze, I knew this place wasn't cheap, but how much was that beer?! $10!? or are the specials at noodlecat that much more expensive?

Yesterday was my fourth, and most likely my final visit to Noodlecat. It was pretty much empty, and I sat by the window. Perfect spot to read my book while waiting for my food. I ordered the Takahachi Ramen for $13 and this time no drink. I would have been more interested in the specials, but the server rambled them off so quickly that I decided not to bother. My food arrived quickly, and after my first bite, I knew I had made a mistake in coming back. I can't say exactly what it was about the soup, but I did not enjoy it at all. It had flavor, but wasn't savory, and the pork was a bit dry and stringy. I finished half of it, paid my bill, and left.

Some people might love Noodlecat. I have overheard other people in the place raving about their food, but unfortunately, I am not one of them. The hours, the location, the atmosphere all cater to the people that live downtown, but sadly, the prices do not. To me, a ramen restaurant should be able to supply of good bowl of soup and a beer for under $10. Even at the current prices, I would still consider visiting once or twice every other month, but the food isn't worth it. A bummer too, because I have never put so much effort into liking one place.",4,oA1KcJVKUYv3fAqLXyS_RQ

I'm pretty into ramen and try to find various takes when traveling or at home. This was my first trip to Ki Ramen and I ordered the Shoyu ramen, feeling chicken broth would cure this crazy spring weather. The broth is tasty--good flavors. Ramen noddles itself are fine, a bit harder than I like and a bit bland. As for the toppings, the cabbage could have been softened and the onsen egg was a little too soft for my taste. (It's softer than a soft-boiled egg.) There are some spice and flavor seasoning on the table (chilli pepper, black peppercorn, and MSG), but nothing that is real heat. I suspect that the red heat that I'm accustomed to with ramen is an extra topping option that I saw on the menu for $1.

The staff was very friendly and accommodating. And our drinks were never empty. And it has a nice vibe. I liked the leftover ropes from when this was a seafood place. 

The jalapeño deviled eggs were amazing and I had such high hopes for the rest of the meal. They were creamy and topped with a pickled jalapeño and they had bacon. To die for. 

Unfortunately, the rest of my meal was not. I opted for the egg Sammy which was egg, grease, and mayo. My mom commented that it looked like a Jack in the Box sandwich -- it did. The side of potatoes looked hopeful, but they were soggy and tasteless. 

The weirdest part was when I asked for hot sauce, they brought me a small cup of cholula instead of the bottle. I did not use the whole cup and I thought it was super wasteful and weird to provide a cup of the sauce instead of just hand over the bottle.

-archeology exhibit seems to have been there forever.  And it's always empty when I go and its pretty clear why. ... it's boring and no one cares.  Truth hurts. 


My advice to any newbies going on a weekend,  GO EARLY,  as in,  right when it opens. Kids will be kids,  and kids will be running around acting a fool and that's totally understandable but you go early,  as early as possible.  Bad days to go. .. field trip day,  aleluiah!

I had been here 3 years ago and had loved it so was really excited to be coming back again. This time around, I felt that the overall experience had gone down a bit, though the food is still above average. Is it worth $60? I think the price point is appropriate, given how expensive everything is these days. However, as another reviewer said below, I think I'd rather pay more somewhere else next time for better food.

Couple of things that stood out: We came at 8PM and were seated at 9PM. I think the wait is unavoidable but the way it's managed could be improved. There is a virtual wait to get in the line, then a wait to get to the cashier, then a wait to actually get seated. 

The food was good, the staff are friendly, but because it's toward the end of the night, you could start to see some of the overall quality control over the experience start to wind down (e.g. plastic cups for drinks because they were running out of glasses, tables remaining uncleaned from previous diners, food refills winding down). 

The positives are: Our server worked really hard to make sure we were okay. The desserts were delicious. We had a good time trying the variety of food out and ended up getting stuffed.

The meat pie is fried, but not greasy, and delicious.  Highly recommend the mashed sweet potato side that comes with the meat pie.  It was whipped with maple butter and very creamy.

I had the chicken katsu curry; for $10-12, you get a pretty good portion. Along with the katsu, there was cabbage and a halved boiled egg on my plate. The curry was not that good though.

Their menu was intriguing; basically, you pick your meat and then you get like 15 or so options on how you want it (kung pao, crunchy walnut, etc...).  There was a deal on a flyer we got that said it feeds 4-5 people.  We went with that as I love having leftovers available for lunch the next day whenever we get Chinese food.  My husband went with the orange shrimp after reading the rave review on here and I went with crunchy walnut chicken.  It also came with white rice, egg drop soup, and pork lo mein.  We ordered 2 eggrolls as a side because the meal didn't come with any.  Sounds like a lot of food right?  Wrong.  $30.00 + tip later, we got the smallest portions I have ever seen.  If you split the dishes between 5 people, each would get about 3 bites of each dish and a child's sized soup.  Not much.  Hope you're not actually hungry if you plan on eating here.  Unless you're willing to fork out a lot of money for extra 'dinners' .  The lo mein was a weird goulash of different noodles and just wasn't good at all.  The shrimp were huge (about the only good thing about this dish) but super spicy.  Not your average orange shrimp; the sauce had no orange flavor.  Come to find out, the orange flavor is in slices of orange peel in the dish.  Hello pesticides.  Not a good dish at all. 
What to say about the chicken...*sigh* My husband said it reminded him of Jack in the Box...which I thought was crazy until I bit into it and realized he was right.  Definitely didn't 'taste like chicken'...and the creamy white sauce looked nasty...AND the walnuts tasted like dirt.  It was so bad, that even though I was starving, I threw it out and opted to eat the white rice with some soy sauce to try to fill my belly up.  Even my husband who will eat almost anything said he couldn't finish it.  The eggrolls were super tiny and also not good at all. What a shame.

On the upside, the soup was actually good.  Oh, and delivery WAS fast...probably because we are the only ones in the greater Tempe area ordering from this place.  Now I know better.

I had jambalaya, which the server gushed about, but it was made with soggy orzo instead of rice which, being Asian, seems just sacrilegious to me.  My husband had the roast chicken, which was just okay, and he was peeved about having to order asparagus on the side.  Someone else at the table ordered a duck dish that had a nice, round flavor to it.  My cocktail was kind of gross--some monstrosity with big slogs of ginger chunks in it.  I like ginger but I don't like it that much, kids.

The best thing about the meal were the appetizers.  I remember the crispy shrimp toast one which was delicious.  If I had to come here again (not by choice, probably), I would like to just get a bunch of appetizers to share.

My friends and I decided to leave after one night b/c our room developed this ""pee"" smell -- which made us rename the place, the Imperial Pee-lace. 

However, I do need to mention our friends had the room next door and didn't have a pee-problem. The people in my room insist that no one peed on the floor, but now I'm beginning to wonder....

Original Review: 
Okay, so the Imperial Palace is definitely not the swankiest, nor the newest, nor the funnest place to go in Vegas. But it has one kitschy, old Vegas thing going for it - the Dealertainers. Don't get me wrong, it's not for everyone, but I love it. After a while, all those new places start to feel the same, look the same. The Dealertainers are black jack dealers that are tier 2 (okay maybe 3) level impersonators. They all deal cards and take turns going up on the mini stage to belt out songs - mental note, look for the speakers and DON'T sit in front of them. I had the pleasure of playing cards with Tina Turner, Stevie Wonder, Debbie Harry, Louis Armstrong, Billy Idol, and someone who may have been a very bad Mariah Carey (it was unclear). Anyway, go there for a different twist on cards - they had $5 minimum tables on a Saturday night - which is a rare find on the strip.",0,VQ-RXIZCH-7eRG8jSMmr9w

egg rolls 4/5-perfect sized egg rolls that have a unique crunch to it and what I love about their egg rolls they give you a lot of vegetables I love the pickled daikon and carrot which they provide here with the lettuce and mint of course. gotta love the sweet fish dipping sauce too!

pho dac biet 4.5/5- that's a big deal because this is now my second favorite pho place to eat. the broth is awesome it's light, yet so flavorful and their pho soup was hot which is how it's supposed to be. sometimes restaurants get scared to serve it too hot as in temperature but it's supposed to be. they come with rare steak, brisket, tendon and meatballs. very good

bun lemongrass beef and onion 4/5- vermicell noodle with lemongrass beef and onion pretty decent dish if you have had bun it has similar qualities of all bun cold noodle with meat and the sweet fish sauce.

milk tea with boba 5/5 and coffee smoothie no boba- great smoothies and drink the milk tea was so good and boba was so soft I would definitely come back just for the boba.

This is a really small store, with barely enough room to stand if there's half a dozen people waiting for their orders or hanging around to chat or other activities after receiving their drink. Fortunately, the sidewalk along Yonge is huge and they have a couple tables and seats set up outside. However, I can't imagine what things will be like once the cold weather rolls around.

The person taking the order did not seem to have a very efficient process figured out, which included taking the orders, sticking the order onto the cups, handling payment, and scanning the rewards app. Sometimes the people making the drinks would mess up, and then he has to do damage control, which means the order process is delayed even further. This likely contributes to the long wait times from the moment you line up, to the moment you receive your receipt.

Scanning the rewards app was also particularly complicated, as he takes the phone to scan with the tablet and then returns it to you. The first time he did this, the rewards didn't go through, which led to me interrupting the order line so that I can get the points added to my account successfully. I don't know if they can check whether it went through or not but it's pretty sloppy.

I ordered the alley trio milk tea, as I had enjoyed it at a different location previously. A large cup is $6, but it includes 3 toppings, one of which tastes quite fruity. The drink itself felt and tasted quite watered down compared to the one I had before which had a richer consistency (more milk perhaps). Toppings were alright, but I'm expecting a much more satisfying drink at this price-point.

I'd rather just go across the street to Palgong and order a classic milk tea for $2.99 which comes with tapioca and a more comfortable seating experience.",3,CQ67NJigSe5-uBDX3b_CUw

I had a couple rolls they make called the CLT roll and the Captain's Roll which were very tasty indeed. I happen to like spicy...both of these rolls have a common spice in using jalapeño peppers either sliced or diced. In addition, the tuna in both dishes was of good flavor and texture. I should clarify that the Captains Roll wasn't really a roll...it was more of a sashimi with yellowtail tuna in ponzu sauce, with sliced jalapeños on top.

Either way, it was exactly what I was looking for in a lunch. Consider this fact as well that this is a sushi place, IN AN AIRPORT, IN NORTH CAROLINA...not what you are expecting to find down this way.

When Graham and I were going to bed Friday night it dawned on me that we had no plans for Saturday morning, so I decided that we needed to have brunch. I hopped on Open Table and made a reservation. The restaurant is over on a side of town that was always pretty shady when I was a kid. So it's very cool to see it being revitalized and filling up with excellent, local places.

Graham and I started with cocktails. I had a $3 mimosa and he had a bloody mary. Their bloody mary bar is pretty awesome. You pick the vodka, and choose from a variety of mixers and add-ins. I had never had a bloody mary before, so I had a sip of his. I took one sip and promptly realized I don't care for them and would be sticking with mimosas.

Graham had a breakfast that was, in his words, ""a vegans nightmare"". This was two eggs, a potato cake, and steaks with carmelized onions and bernaise sauce. This breakfast made me wish I liked runny eggs, because this looked so, so good. I did try the steak though, and it (and the sauce) was so delicious.

His breakfast had nothing on my french toast. This was a huge piece of brioche, fresh fruit, syrup and orange zest. This was sweet, delicious and filling. I typically don't like syrup on my french toast, but with the fruit and the hint of orange flavor, it really worked. I would order this again and again. I did order a side of bacon (un-pictured), which was just okay. It was thick, but wasn't crispy at all.

At every Mexican restaurant I go to, I typically always order the Carnitas for the entree, so I did just that. First, the Ceviche ($10) came out in a cocktail glass as some sort of dip. I was looking forward to a salad. Very disappointed! Second, my Carnitas came. It was swimming in a pool of watery sauce on my plate, with a side of rice and refried beans. It tasted like it was boiled with very little spices or marinade. Very bland. I am used to the baked/fried carnitas that are crispy in some areas. Very bland. Very disappointing. My wife ordered the chicken fajita salad and she said that the chicken was also very bland. Overpriced and terrible food. 

The only positive things I can say is that the space and location is nice, the wait staff was nice, and the kids menu is cheap. Other than that, we won't be coming back again.",1,4U628IMVQaGuy1wuhy4BNQ

On the plus side our server was very nice and helpful, and the pizza was decent. It's basic chain-style pizza, so nothing too exciting but PH Pan pizza is not bad. It's at least a little different. They have a new menu which seems pretty good with a lot of new options, including ""drizzles"" for the crust. My issues is that the hand-tossed crust now automatically comes wth garlic drizzle which I didn't see mentioned. It would've been nice if that was mentioned before I ordered it (especially since it is a ""new feature""). The drizzle was not that good.

The place was nearly empty but they managed to mess up our order and the order of a table next to us (we ordered at roughly the same time). Apparently they were ""slammed"" with orders at the same time but based on how many people were there 

The actual restaurant is in bad shape. It looks like the interior hasn't been refreshed since it opened years ago. And it is just not particularly clean. The bathroom was  disgusting with flies all over it. Even the brand new menus were sticky with sauce already. Clearly they don't value cleanliness at this location. It makes me wonder what the kitchen looks like. On second thought maybe I shouldn't think about that.

First, the chicken and fries don't come as pictured. The chicken I got was tiny tiny pieced. The menu and on Facebook, the chicken and fries come in these round, silver/aluminum containers. We received them in brown Chinese take out like boxes that are much much smaller. The ""ranch"" it came with was mayo. Not ranch. Just mayo. Thought it was weird. Again Facebook pictures show the ranch next to the chicken and it looks like ranch (white with speckles of seasoning. Mine just white) The ""ranch"" I got literally looked like it just came out of a mayo squeeze tube. Pretty sure it did. They spend a lot of time marketing and posting great pictures online however it's not like that in person. Drinks are great! Food, eh.

When we first walked in, around 530 in the evening on a Wednesday during an Indians game, there were maybe three other tables occupied in the restaurant. We stood in front of the hostess station while a waitress rolling napkins attempted to avoid our gaze and four other waiters/waitresses walked by us. We stood there for literally...ten minutes until the waitress who was trying to avoid us by folding napkins was told to seat us. 

Perhaps it was our fault for not saying anything? 

No, their service is just really poor, and none of the employees there really care about customer service. 

While I was waiting for someone to notice my boyfriend and I, the ambiance of the restaurant is fairly nice. Dimly lit, a little classier feel to it but nothing remarkable. There is no parking, you have to park in a garage. The bathrooms are weird public bathrooms down the stairs and around the corner, also. 

It was happy hour, and their specials were not communicated anywhere online, nor shown anywhere on the menu... and our waitress did a poor job verbally explaining it. Their signature martinis are not part of happy hour, and ONLY SOME APPETIZERS ARE $4.95. The Chocolate Bar randomly picks week to week, or day to day, or maybe they choose it based on what you order. I'm not really sure.  

As for drinks, I love chocolate-based liquory nonsense drinks. I would really recommend a Chocolate Covered Pretzel Martini, it was really well made, delicious, chocolately, and I couldn't taste the liquor. However, for my second drink I ordered a Nutella Martini, which was legitimately poorly made. It was not simply poured heavily, it did not taste like Nutella and the vodka was extremely apparent. I was really surprised they did not use Frangelico hazelnut liquor, or anything remotely resembling Nutella. I was also surprised that each Martini did not list the types of liquors in each. I personally think that the Hofbrauhaus has much better speciality dessert martinis for $8 (rather than $10 at the chocolate bar)

I did not have dinner, but I ordered a chocolate cake, and I have no complaints with it. It was rich, fudgey, yummy, but nothing I couldn't have gotten somewhere else. I can't remember what it was called, unfortunately. 

I don't really see a reason to come back here, particularly because of the service.",0,nfGC_3F7-urw7FirVRMcdA

I had bought shoes as a Christmas gift and they were too narrow for my boyfriend to fit in them. So I brought them back hoping he could have them exchanged for another shoe he liked. Well it turns out size 10 is very popular and there was NO shoe he wanted available in his size in store or online. Hes not extremely picky either so he asked for about 6 different shoes and no luck. We couldnt even get them from other stores! So we asked Emma if we could just get store credit to spend it later when we find something else we like and she said no. We were 10 days past the return/exchange policy and apparently we were lucky she even considered letting us exchange them in the first place! I let her know that we would literally be throwing our money away if we exchanged the shoes for a pair he didnt even want and she said shes sorry but we need to think of this from the COMPANY'S point of view: ""We cant just let anyone come in 4 months later off the street to return shoes because we dont know what happened to them."" 
I was like, wait, what??? First of all, we're not from the street. We're customers who have a legit receipt and the COMPANY doesnt have any shoes he wants in his size. The shoes Im returning are WHITE all around so you can see theyre in perfect condition. 
She kept repeating the same thing and i was so fed up I called the corporate office. They apologized for her because obviously policies are just guidelines and even though she had the power to give us store credit, she didnt, and thus will require more training on what the COMPANY actually requires of her. 

We're so done with this store. We went to the Foot Locker at AZ Mills and told them what happened and the manager there gave us store credit and said this isnt the first time its happened. Emma has pissed off a lot of people so I hope she gets it together and learns how to appreciate money-spending customers.",0,t6uAOJHnui8zl2-PJ9m_Jw

Came here for lunch before leaving Vegas - and obviously not a good one at all.

We were a party of 6 adults and 2 children - we ordered 6 dishes:

House Steamed Chicken with the ginger onion dipping sauce - there were barely any meat on the chicken - quite frankly it was nearly all bones and skin.

Seafood Tofu Pot - this dish was okay 

Soy Sauce Beef Chow Fun - it was like they pour oil all over it before serving it - it was very hard to eat when it's slipping off your fork/chopstick.

Beef Stew Lo Mein with Wontons - the noodles were disgusting! it was soggy and not to mention tasteless. 

Duck Noodle Soup with Wontons - again the noodles were disgustingly soggy...wontons were bland and there was not much meat on the pieces of duck.

Chinese Broccoli sauteed with garlic - pretty greasy and it was definitely very aged broccoli 

They also charge for rice - per bowl..

Normally at the Sam Woo back at home (San Gabriel, CA) ordering 6 dishes for lunch amounts to about 30 dollars - 40 dollars at most but here it was unbelievably 90 dollars!  

The service was just as bad - it wasn't busy but had to ask several times for things plus one of the waitress openly and loudly complained about another table of diners that left - how they asked for utensils but didn't use them.

They've been open for about a year now and I'm hoping to tell all of Cleveland about them so that they will STAY open.

Have you ever seen the Discovery Science television show ""Oddities""? If not, it's about this little antique shop in NYC called Obscura.

The adorable shop owner told me he bought something he saw on the show and this item is now for sale in his shop -- it was some sort of ocular device (read: torture) used by ophthalmologists back in the day.  

If you still have no idea what I'm talking about.... this shop has some really cool shit. Things you would possibly find at the Mutter Museum in Philly. Or just random things you would find at other vintage shops like antique perfume bottles and the occasional rare kitchen item. But the best example of the items you can find here are creepy old dolls with cracked faces (they have quite a collection!), mounted insect collections, random vintage musical instruments (I saw a sitar in there), plenty of religious relics, old photographs, and zombie dolls/stuffed animals that were made by one of the owners or various artists who may consign there.

Brunch, they kept calling it. Brunch they said. $20 a head - cash only. 

We arrive. It's not brunch. It's less than 10 dishes none of which are - OK I'm going to pause this for a second to tell you that as a person with eating things (gluten free, vegetarian) I DO NOT IN ANY WAY expect a gluten free vegetarian buffet. 

I do, however expect to see some items that are fitting with ""brunch"" at a brunch this was NOT the case. It was like a luncheon for a board meeting, two meats, green beans a soggy veggie tray and some desserts.

I thought, OK I'll have some salad and a cup of coffee and accept that my eating needs aren't typical BUT WE HAD TO PAY $2.50 for a cup of terrible drip coffee.

AT A BUFFET THAT WAS $20/person. No water was offered to us. Just a cash bar with an unhappy bartender and expensive beer. $7 for a grasshopper for my Papa.

So, I went down stairs to the grill where they have ""All day breakfast"" according to their menu - which is not true! That's their OLD menu. 

I just wanted some god damn eggs.

And then out of the heavens arrived Pam who is currently hooking me up with two scrambled eggs that she convinced the cook to make. Pam is a real champ. She's a good manager and I truly felt for her and everyone working at this godforsaken place.

Just warm bottles of pop and cans of beer.

The same issue with the meat in my son's steak rolls and nephews dish. The vegetables were burnt on several of our plates. There were 9 of us and 6 people got the their food after 30-40 minutes. The other three half an hour after that. The majority of our party was done eating. The hummus trio is very good as was the bread.

For lunch Z Pizza is a decent choice...the times I have been there service is quick and there is plenty of seating to be had. The parking lot is really small and fills up quickly, but don't let that deter you.

The first time I went for lunch I had the pasta with grilled chicken, pinenuts, and basil pesto. For the most part it was a good dish even though the pasta was a tad overcooked. It wasn't an overly large portion, but was the perfect amount for lunch.  I believe the pasta and a drink was close to $10.  I have also had the Moroccan pizza (pesto, feta cheese, pinenuts, and eggplant) which was very tasty although it could have used a bit more feta. For a slice of the Moroccan, a garden salad, and a drink, it was $8.  Some of my coworkers who I dine with also enjoy the calzone (you will have to wait about 10 minutes for it though) and the Santa Fe pizza.

I'm not really a fan of gourmet pizza, but for a lunch spot downtown it is not bad. It's not my first choice but not a place I drag my heels to go to either. The one good thing about this Z Pizza location is that they will deliver at night to the State Capitol which we had them do once this fall when we were working late.",4,ZQYNombDho1PYfnEWFZevw

I had the Chicken del Sol (a Southwest style chicken cooked with diced tomatoes, garlic, black beans, and sweet corn), which comes with a chipotle cheddar pita crisp.  The chicken itself was better than most, but what really made the meal was the chipotle cheddar pita.  It complimented the dish perfectly.  Perhaps most surprising were the portion sizes, given the relatively low cost.  I did not expect to have so much food.

Serving eight people is difficult for anyone, but the waitress handled our party's size decently well.  The only mistake we had was an incorrectly-prepared dish, which the staff replaced without a fuss.  It is the only thing keeping my review from being five stars.

Even went to the Mob Museum across the street. I thought the price was high at first but after 3 hours, I got my money's worth. 
As far as the hotel goes, wish it had closer self park so I could easily get things out of my car, I used the complimentary valet instead. 

The room was clean and fresh. Needed a refrigerator to place my left over pizza in for later and a coffee maker would be nice too.

The half glass shower thing as mentioned elsewhere is odd. I like to have a towel near me when I shower to dry my eyes but there is no place to put one. 
Most of all, it needs dark out curtains! Vegas is basically ugly during the day so it's nice to stay out late, with the curtains closed my east facing room lit up like a super market at sunrise.

He answered the phone on a holiday weekend, and was very helpful, answering all of my questions. He came out soon to check the type of glass we needed, and he found that we have low-e glass on the sliding glass doors. This is not that common and needed to be ordered, which only took a couple extra days. Also, he came out on a weekend to install the glass once it arrived. 

Since we have dogs, we had been keeping them inside 99% of the time, until Mark came to fix the glass, because we were afraid the dogs would push on the glass and knock it out of the door frame. When he arrived and determined that we had low-e glass, and he let us know we would need to wait for the glass to be ordered, he carefully scraped off the outer layer of shattered glass, cleaned it all up, and taped around the edges of the remaining unbroken pane, so we could let our dogs out while we waited for the low-e glass to arrive. This was such a big help, and we really appreciated it. He was on-time, very friendly, and very professional.

It's within walking distance of my house and it gives off a more sophisticated vibe than most of the other bars on Mill Avenue.  (I suppose if that's what I'm looking for, I'm in the wrong neighborhood...or I'm just getting old.)  So far, I'd say the place lives up to the hype for the most part.

I have been here a couple times on Saturday nights and the place was packed both times.  Mostly, though, I show up for happy hour during the week, which ranges from sparse to moderately crowded.  Given the place is fairly new, I wanted to get a feel for what it has to offer.  Overall, I'd say their happy hour can't be beat.  House margs and some small plates are half-off from 4 to 6:30, 7 days a week.  I've stayed the full two-and-a-half hours on multiple occasions and I can honestly say I've never broken the $18 mark (pre-tip).  To give you a benchmark, that's 3-4 margs, an order of tacos, and 2 rounds of chips and salsa.  I've cut myself off at least once, as the house margs are generally strong and I'd rather not be hungover on a Wednesday.  The chips come with a 'flight' of salsas (chipotle, verde, pico) and the chips are top-notch.  The tacos come in 3's and are quite tasty (I recommend the fish).

Overall, Canteen places the emphasis on their expansive tequila selection, small plates, and ambiance.  It has a courtyard patio on the south side and and open-air bar to the north.  Indoor seating appears comfy and dimly-lit, and although I have not partaken, it seems to make for a relaxed and intimate group setting.  While they do offer full-course dinners, I don't recall ever seeing someone order that much food here.  I've sampled most of the unique margaritas on their menu and they are all potent and flavorful.

One thing that I find a bit disappointing, however, is that the menu lists most of the drinks with their ingredients, leading me to believe that they are all made by hand.  Watching the bartender prepare my drink I noticed that most of them (at least the core ingredients) are pre-mixed in a mixer container.  And while they aren't bad from a taste or alcohol-content standpoint, I still feel a bit cheated.  I have been to similar establishments that make all their cocktails by hand each and every time.  For a place that fancies itself an upscale tequila bar, I think they're losing points by cutting that corner.

Also, the staff is constantly rotating.  Obviously this doesn't necessarily detract from the overall experience, but I did manage to have the same bartender on more than one occasion, and just as I was getting familiar with him he has not worked that shift regularly since.  Personally, I like to know the folks that work the bar at my favorite drinking spots.  I like the rapport; it tends to make things easier if you frequent a place regularly.  That's just me, though.

Like I said, I really want this to be my favorite Tempe bar.  I give Canteen four stars mainly because every establishment has room to improve and I tried to critique them as fairly as possible.  I highly recommend their daily happy hour and patio seating.",3,dqXw3f-9JlzjNXpOaNomdA

z_IKNghnlqZWUgkyU9liIw,0,2016-04-14,0,2r14YUMMTKDEIT6dALf63A,"My wife and little boy went to Healing Hearts around 1:00pm on 4/13/2016 because my son had been throwing up, vomiting, and had a high fever (son is almost 2 years old).  My wife was not received by a doctor, but by Sonia the Nurse Practitioner and she diagnosed my son with having an ear infection. 

Sonia asked my wife which pharmacy she preferred, my wife told her the Walgreens on Alma School and Guadalupe.  Before leaving, my wife asked for the prescription and the nurse said that they would call and order it in and to not worry about it, that they would get it taken care of.  

Around 4:45pm that same day, my wife didn't hear anything from Walgreens so she called the pharmacy and they said that nothing had been ordered yet.  My wife, knowing that Healing Hearts would close quickly, called them and they said that it had been ordered at the Walgreens on Dobson and Warner.  My wife told them No and that it needed to be ordered at Alma School and Walgreens.  

Later that evening, we went to Walgreens and we were told that they didn't have any record that the prescription had been ordered.  Worried, we went to the other Walgreens on Dobson and Warner and they said the same thing.  Thinking there may have been a mistake in the pharmacy company, we even went to CVS but none of their locations showed anything was ordered.  After driving around for an hour and a half, I began to realize that Healing Hearts never ordered the prescription.  HEALING HEARTS NOT ONLY DIDN'T ORDER THE PERSCRIPTION, THEY LIED ABOUT ORDERING IT. 

To put it simply--my son had a nasty fever all night, the vomitings continued, and he slept that night roughly an hour.    

The following morning, 4/14/2016, I called Healing Hearts to speak with a manager or doctor so that I could file a complaint.  I spoke with Tatiana who told me that Sonia wouldn't be in until 9:30am, and that the office manager Vick and the doctor had a meeting and she would have them call me back.  I asked who is responsible for ordering prescriptions and she told me it would be the doctor/nurse that attended us--in this case Sonia  I called the other location in Gilbert to inquire about where I could file a complaint and said that all complaints needed to go through the Chandler office administrator Vick.  I was transferred to his voicemail.

Vick called me back, and then in a defensive tone he proceeded to tell me that he shows that it was ordered electronically and that they would order it again to make sure it went through.  Who am I to hold responsible, Walgreens or Healing Hearts?  There comes a certain point where you have to take responsible for your errors and mistakes, don't blame the technology when your offices customer service is reprehensible.    

To say the least, my family will NEVER go back after experiencing what happened with Healing Hearts and Sonia.  I would not be surprised if this problem is just tip of the iceberg for the real issues happening there.

 I have bi-polar dining experiences with McCormick and Schmicks. My first ever time there the waiter was charming, funny and attentive he brought me extra breakdand lemon wedges upon request. The sauce that the garlic mussels in was so good I had to finish all of it, long after the mussels where gone.  After eating the crume brulee I obsessed over it for days.The ambience of the resturant on that date created a romanctice mood.

I have also made several trips in between the first and last time. 

However on my very last  visit I took my younger sibling to a breakfast buffet here.  It was disgusting I was T.O at the garbage they were feeding to these little kids.  The plates were dirty,  and everything had a refrigerated taste even the pasties. My heart breaks that any establishment would serve nasty left overs to children.

While thinking back on the whirlwind four days I spent here, I can't help but smile every time I see my brand new tattoo. 

My origami panda stares back at me with perfectly straight lines and simply just exceeds every expectation that I could have had. My tattoo artist at Club Tattoo, Wakako was amazing. Don't let her petite statute and gentle voice fool you, she's got more skill with the needle than a samurai with a sword! Her artistic vision not only impressed me, but got my buddy to immediately request a tattoo from her after seeing mine done. You can't go wrong with this lady - take a look at her profile. Trust me. She's a pro! 

Perhaps what parallels my amazing tattoo was the overall shop experience. I was lucky enough to get to interact quite extensively with a good number of people, from Thora, who was willing to work with me and get a hard to find Pyrrha piece, to Joni, Lani, Robert, and let's not forget the two amazing ladies, Anita and Arkay. Every single person made my experience just that much better - and they successfully worked my wallet and bank account empty! 

The best part is that I'm leaving with great memories, and amazing tattoo, and one serious problem: I want to come back for more tattoos, and just to freaking chat with everyone!

- 2 cool pool / dipping baths
- waterfall showers!
- a 12-showerhead shower
- heated marble-mosaic lounge chairs (omg omg omg)
- steam room
- awesome sauna
- all the cucumber- or orange-infused ice water I could drink, a fine selection of teas, and some sort of gently-spiced mixed nut snack. (Like I said, easily impressed).

We came here early on a Sunday (no wait) and were immediately seated. We sat for about 4-5 minutes when finally we were greeted. Not only did the waitress (Jennifer g) push for drink order, but also food order. It felt so rushed. My husband stumbled through the menu and ordered without really knowing what he wanted. We waited about ten minutes and the food came out very fast. We didn't see the server that entire time. When the food was dropped, Jennifer came back and gave us our check! She didn't check on how the food was, she didn't ask if we needed refills, just the check. We felt so pushed out, it was ridiculous. The food itself is ok. The portions are ridiculously large, but it really wasn't that great. The breakfast eat all tastes previously frozen. The one saving grace is the hash brown casserole, which is the only reason this review is two stars than one star.  After eating, we did a quick scan of the table, made sure the kids had everything, and left.  We paid with the cashier and walked to the car. At that point it had been maybe three minutes. We realized my son had forgotten his favorite hotwheels car and my husband went inside to retrieve it.  There was already a new couple at the table and he asked the hostess if the busboy had found it.  Nope, they had thrown it away.

Quince's semi annual Indonesian Rijsttafel ($55/person) that I experienced on September 28th, 2001 was such a treat!

What is Rijsttafel? I even have problem pronouncing it.  It is a Dutch word that literally translates to ""rice table"", is an elaborate meal adapted by the Dutch from the Indonesian feast called nasi padang.*

Rijsttafels strive to feature an array of not only flavors and colors and degrees of spiciness but also textures, an aspect that is not commonly discussed in Western food. Such textures may include crispy, chewy, slippery, soft, hard, velvety, gelatinous, and runny.*

I was intrigued when I saw the menu. My Yelp Friend even taken back and asked the waiter if we need to choose from the given menu. Our friendly waiter just asked us to relax, no decisions need to be made as every single item list on the menu would be served to us!! That's what I call a feast!!! A food adventure!

So much food... a steady parade of little dishes were served to us the whole evening. Some are good, Some are so so, Some are meh. But it was the concept, the experience, the atmosphere I enjoyed here at Quince that made this evening memorable.

I was so overdosed with food by the 2nd round of the rice table, ended up packing enough for lunch for 2 people the next day. And the food surprising tasted even better after I heated it up in the microwave!

Thanks Quince for putting together this special Indonesian Rijsttafel feast! It was such a real culinary adventure!

Being my first time trying a Korean BBQ restaurant, the atmosphere was pretty cool. I enjoyed being able to grill right within my own personal booth. The food came out fresh; definitely loved the grilled calamari and short ribs.

The Negative:
The service at this establishment was atrocious. The wait staff seemed as if I was the bane of their existence each time I had to ask for common items: Soup? Probably need a spoon. Beverage? A refill would be nice. Extra napkins? I can't get by one 1, single ply napkin for my entire lunch. I wish I would have known I could have had a grill change. Probably something to communicate to a first timer, as my grill was, to be expected, very charred.

-24 hour deal for the buffets such as Carnival, PH, Paris, etc. 

cons-
-parking is far 
-old people casino
-bad customer service
-worse room I have ever stayed in

Experienced the worst customer service here. When we got to the room, we were disappointed to see how ""big"" the room was...which it was not that big at all being a suite & all.. It seemed like a regular hotel room. 
The air conditioner sucked ass.. we had blasted at 60 and we were still fanning ourselves and that was after we had complained and they had someone ""fix it"" by replacing the filter.. I guess you cant expect too much since the RIO is one of the oldest hotels in vegas...
The towel hangers came off... yea..surprise surprise..

the bed sheets had nasty brown spots..

the refrigerator felt like a cooler would have been a better and cooler option. 

Lastly the pull out bed looked like it has been ""pulled"" all over the place.. the mattress was completely falling apart... it was sad for my friend who had to put up with it for one night and he even hurt himself trying to pull that disgusting old thing out of the couch. 


When I complained the next day all they could do was ""send someone out for repairs""... I really was not trying to upgrade to a bigger room just a room that is not terrible... even if it is the same kind just a different room. ..and I asked the lady how long it would take because obviously this is an inconvenience for us.. she stared at me with a nasty look and replied, ""well you can stay int he room!""..-- wow what an awesome customer service you just gave me you incompetent worthless customer service representative... I mean really I just want to be comfortable and do you really expect that we can sleep and feel like we have some privacy with 3 men walking around the room and fixing things and moving the couch out and putting in a new one? really? really? okay yeah sure I would love to stay in the room and awkwardly try to ignore the three men trying to ""fix things"". 


the casino sucked as well.. its all OLD people. like old people that smell.

they offer a shuttle every 30 mins but its too bad its only good until 1 am so if you are out partying late then you either walk you ass home or pay for a cab(about $15).


overall our experience here was terrible. 

I recommend that you DO NOT plan on getting a room here.
Get the 24 hour buffet deal if you dont want to spend a lot on food.. buy it around 7 pm and you will be covered until 7 pm the next day.. so that covers your dinner, breakfast, lunch, and dinner again. Just don't stuff you face just because its a ""buffet"". We took advantage and ate at the Rio, Planet Hollywood, and almost at the Paris for crepes but we made it too late.

I also recommend bringing your own blankets.. the brown one that they give you is gross and feels like its made out of foam.. its not comfortable or soft. 


don't bother looking into this hotel.",1,K7wS9o3PukRMBj0ch9kebA

Famously known as the lone occupant of Mandalay Bay's 63rd Floor, a Restaurant-slash-Nightclub that remains one of Sin City's lone proponents of a dress-code demanding Business Casual or better, it is within the hotel lobby that guests will find elevators behind a velvet rope, the ascent fairly quick to a space designed to impress and staff clearly hired as much for their looks as abilities to seat and serve.

One of eight such venues across America, the recent hiring of Chef Corey Miller from Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak at MGM promising upcoming menu changes per a middle-aged male waiter, it is after passing by statues of Buddha and other Deities that guests are seated in a room of polished wood with a balcony offering a panoramic view of Las Vegas Boulevard, a ""guest-list"" and/or cover charge apparently the only way to assure admission after dark on busier nights.

Priced significantly higher than House of Blues Restaurant or recently introduced B-Side, Happy Hour in the spacious Bar offering some good deals Sunday through Thursday while the current Restaurant Week three-course offers over 25% off a collection of longtime signatures, it was with Strip-priced Cocktails deferred that a Bread Basket appeared featuring five options alongside three Dips or Spreads, the fact that some were still warm a nice touch though only the Ciabatta lightly speckled with Olives and Crisps spread with Red Pepper Hummus proved worth more than a single taste.

Playing mid-tempo Pop overhead, the lack of Blues or even Rock telling as much about Foundation Room's target audience as a menu loosely rooted in the South but otherwise nondescript American 'Steakhouse,' it was with ""Salmon and a Salad with Dressing on the side"" tourists seated on both sides that Foundation Room's ""Jumbo"" Lump Crabcakes were presented, the adjective in reference not to portion but the chunks of sweet Crustacean that showed well without much binder beneath a fairly basic Apple and Fennel Salad.  

Decidedly curious about $40 Shrimp and Grits, ""My Cousin Vinny"" quotes about *Magic* Grits seemingly the only explanation for such a price, it was perhaps predictable that neither portion nor presentation outperformed what one gets at Yardbird for $28 or down South for $15, the fact that Shrimp were well cooked but largely overwhelmed by spices and salinity also worth noting.

Excellent in terms of service, both the Waiter and Runners present without being obtrusive and always quick to clear plates or refill Water, it was after Chef Miller toured the room checking in on guests that Dessert was presented, a small ramekin with bubbling Berries at the base and Custard-soaked Cubes of Bread beneath melting Peanut Butter Ice Cream definitely the night's highlight while ""fresh baked"" Cookies that arrived no more than five minutes after ordering were probably better described as ""warmed-to-order,"" the flavors just fine but texture medium-crisp from edge to center and none as noteworthy as the Bourbon Vanilla Ice Cream that is sweet yet subtle and one of the better scoops in Sin City.

TWO AND A HALF STARS:  Undeniably a concept more about the scene than its cuisine The House of Blues Foundation Room offers an experience well-suited to tourists and something 'fancy' but accessible, though with so many great Restaurants at Mandalay Bay and Rivea offering a better view at a similar pricepoint there seems little reason to book a table rather than just stopping in for Ice Cream or a Drink at the Bar.",4,U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA

We ate there on more than one occasion and usually got the appetizers (Nachos and Chicken tenders).  Loved the food, a lot more than my husband and I could eat and the waitresses really took care of you even when you were just ordering drinks.  We sat out in the bar part by the mechanical bull and had great sevice even during the busy times.  

Every night they have a special theme, we really enjoyed World Famous Bikini Bull Riding.  There was a DJ and 5 girls rode the bowl and they had promotions where you could get free stuff from their sponsors.  I had a lot of fun both because of what I was drinking and the entertainment.  They have line dancing classes at certain times, you can ride the mechanical bull or just watch others partake in it.  If you want to have a seat you need to get their a little earlier than it starts or if you don't mind standing don't worry about the timing, either way you will enjoy yourselves at Gilley's.  

The waitresses are all dressed cute and they get on the dance floor at times and are very good at the line dances.  They are willing to take pictures with the customers and it makes for a great memory of your trip.  You are encouraged to wear your western wear while you are there, but not required.

I'm a huge Postino Arcadia fan, so when my husband suggested we head to this new location for a little lunch date last week, I was all about it.  

They did a great job on the space itself; it's warm and cozy despite being much larger in square footage compared to the Phoenix locations.  The staff was super friendly as well.

The menu is the same, and despite the Bella Postino (hummus and artichoke spread) appetizer tasting a little off, everything else we had was delicious.  That being said, our waitress brought us a second artichoke spread that was warmer and less watery after our giving her a heads-up about the first round.

I highly recommend the bruschetta to share (with your fave glass of wine of course).  You can't really make a wrong selection here, but my favorite selections are:
*Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone
*Brie & Apples with Fig Spread
*Salami with Pesto
*Smoked Salmon with Pesto
(in that order)

Their seasonal selections are usually worth giving a shot as well.

It was my third time at DonDon, and I love the environment more and more each time. With such a big group, we had the chance to dine in the big room in the back (where we had to remove our shoes). It was a very interesting experience. 

I had a dinner planned with my coworkers prior to this late dinner at DonDon, so I did not order much. Wish I had a bigger appetite though... The menu is extensive! Half the menu was drinks, the other half was full of pictures of food with descriptions in both English and Japanese. It was quite overwhelming... Our friends ended up focusing only on the items with a picture that had ""recommended"" or ""popular"" written over them. 

The Polar Beer was a bit disappointing. I expected the foam at the top to be completely frozen, but it tasted more like beer slushy. It also made a huge mess because the beer dripped all around the mug. 

The only items I ordered to go with my beer were the Spicy Grilled Squid and 5 Skewers Combo (with salt). The grilled squid is nothing special, as with most of the skewers, but the pork belly was really good. 

As for dessert, the Green Tea Mousse with Red Bean was all right, but the Taro Potato ice cream really tasty -- it's definitely something I would order again! 

Throughout the entire night, the servers were all very friendly and welcoming. The service was not amazing though as one of us kept having to peek out or even step out of the room to wave a server down every time we needed something.

Food: For the starter I had the Shrimp Toast, the shrimp on top was sweet/sour/spicy but a bit too much. The pancake however was stuffed with shrimp and very tasty. My friend got the Penang Chicken which she liked but the Shrimp Toast was better.  We also ordered their classic slaw with salmon sashimi off the a la carte menu and it was delicious. It's a huge portion of 19, fresh ingredients with a light dressing. However, it was $12 extra for only a few pieces of fish. For mains I ordered the Pan Seared Halibut. The fish was okay but I liked the turnip cakes a lot. My friend tried the Duck Confit which was tender and flavourful, I wish I had ordered that instead. For dessert, you get a trio of Strawberry Rhubarb Compote with chia seeds, Coconut Panna Cotta and a Brownie. The compote was probably my favorite, while the brownie was nothing special.   

Drinks: I had the Shanghai 75 which was fresh tasting with cucumber and ginger while my friend had the White Orchid which was sweet with lychee and more boozy on the tongue. Both of the drinks (and all of the food) was presented beautifully. 

Service: Our server was professional and happy to provide us with suggestions for food and drink. All of the courses were timed perfectly and we never felt rushed. 

Atmosphere: The restaurant is beautiful decorated, a bit on the formal side with dim lighting and tons of Asian influence. I would highly recommend for a date.

Also, instead of standing in line for multiple hours, Bacchanal has several kiosks where you can input your cell phone number and receive an expected time for your seating. That way, you can wander the Caesars Forum shops or the casino until you're called back to the restaurant. Once you're called, there is still a 15-30 min. wait for your seat, but that's much better than multiple hours.

Anyways, they have the usual suspects - crab legs, shrimp, and 'world' cuisine (Italian, Chinese, Mexican, and Japanese). You can have your sushi with a taco or some crab legs with your porridge. Overall, I thought the place was well-appointed and the quality of food was good. The dessert bar was expansive - so much to choose from - from cheesecakes to shaved ice to gelato to cake pops.

I got a seat in row 4 which has its own door that can be closed. There is a huge amount of counter space as seen in the photos. The seat came with a substantial pillow and a blanket that provided a moderate amount of warmth. Also came with an amenity kit on such a short flight, which was a pleasant surprise. There was also bottled water at the seat, which is a great touch.

The seat is fully lie flat and quite long in length, though I don't know the exact length. There were a few storage areas, which is probably ample for most. 

Flight attendants took drink orders before takeoff and explained the seat features. Got the signature mint cocktail which was light and refreshing. 
For the food, I got the grilled cheese, tomato soup, and ice cream (from a LA creamery I believe). Grilled cheese had crisp bread and tasted amazing. Tomato soup didn't have much flavor and the portion size was pretty small. Ice cream was also very good. 

Overall, the hard product is fantastic at a very low price; certainly better than AA domestic first or United's old lie flat seats or United First. Comparable to Singapore Air business. Food was fairly good as a whole and service was attentive. Would highly recommend trying JetBlue Mint out!",1,D0yV9ThPzkfvCsnxbkna6Q

I was so accustomed to steak dinners for under $20 that I forgot how much restaurants really charge for a good meal.
I have to say it can really smack the happy Vegas frame of mind right out of you.

The Prime Rib Loft is one of the restaurants guilty of distorting the prices of food.

To start, the quality and flavor of meat is nowhere close to The House of Prime Rib.
But for the price, who cares?

But to be fair to The Prime Rib Loft, my meal was comparable to the ones I've had at either Broadway or San Mateo Prime.

I usually get the biggest cut (to the dismay of the wife) and spend the next hour trying to stuff in down my belly (again, to the dismay of the wife).

The meal comes with a salad and choice of two side dishes.
The prime rib is tender and juicy, but it is also a little fatty and in need of more seasoning.

For dessert, I usually ask for another sliver of meat to top me off and was about to make my request when I felt a sharp pain.
It wasn't from my heart but more from my shin.
It was my wife's subtle way of telling me not to even dare.

Now, I DIDN'T order a pizza...I know right. If my gluten intolerance would give me a break that would be very different.

I got some big green salad which turned out to be rather literal with the word big. So good too. By the end I was ready to break. After that we got fries and  ""crispy"" green beans. Yep, both really great. The fries are a little different just warnin yuh. The green beans really hit the spot and gave me something to take home. 

Everyone around me got pizza and I don't remember anyone saying it was anything special. The woman beside me ordered ribs.

A major negative is the overwhelming stench of cigarette smoke that overpowers your senses as soon as you step into the lobby.

Ok so it's about 2 years since the previous review and not much changed. Our server tonight was not very good. We waited longer than we should have for her to come over and take our drink order. After waiting a long time for the drinks, they came and I had an incorrect beverage. She finally came back after 10 minutes and when I told her the drink was wrong, she laughed that she had given my drink to someone at another table. I was wondering why she waited for me to point that out to her when she had known that for several minutes.  I asked her for a straw when she brought the replacement beverage and it took about 10 minutes to get that. We put in our order and it  seemed to take a long time for the appetizer.

During this time there were lots of servers and employees kind of standing around and no one bothering to bring us our dinner. When our dinner was finally brought over, you will be shocked to find out all the pasta was iced cold. We had to go up to the staff who was busy chatting and ask for a manager. He was apologetic to us, but when he went back to the open kitchen, we could hear him laughing at us with the chef. (Seriously, like he forgot this is an open kitchen area.). The server came over and was mortified that we had spoken to the manager. She never once apologized for anything.  He brought our pasta back and it was--meh.

Ordered delivery recently at 11:30am. By 1:10 there were still no updates on the order, so I called. The guy on the phone was aloof and unapologetic, telling me that there was some sort of error on their end and that they're working on it.

I had to press him for this information, and he appeared annoyed by my questions. I finally got my order at 2pm, after two phone calls with the driver who ""couldn't find the building"".

The restaurant was immaculate and well taking care of.  Super modern but dark as hell.  Smart move to truly prevent us from seeing the subpar quality of the food.  But daddy knows quality with taste and smell, not just sight alone.  The loo was super cool and super clean.

Service was slower than slow!  And the waiter was kinda odd and said it was super busy.  It was not even close to busy, not even close to their capacity.  If they consider that busy, the problem is definitely theirs.  Although he was slow and odd, he was friendly and polite. 

The food was average, actually I'm gonna be real, it sucked!  Not worth the high price at all.  The eel was not fresh, and the tuna had a funky taste unlike anything I had ever ate.  Note I have eating plenty of fish in my life.  I wouldn't be surprised if it was Walmart grade tuna...The eggplant has no taste, the egg was cold, the banana looked like a ""wiener"".  A deep freaking fried wiener.  The water tasted like the sewer and the lemon couldn't save it.  A cucumber might have though.  The wonton soup, that puny thing was not worth no 5 dollars, what was that a kids meal soup?  And the avocado roll, was more avocado than rice... so imbalanced.  Might as well went to Trader Joe's and pick up a dozen all organic Avocados at that price. 

Overall an approaching average experience, will not be back.  Lower your prices or bring up the quality.  That's my advice for this place.  On a positive note, the restroom was cool..... I squid inked it good in there... just kidding!",63,f__9p6lo6hmwnAEh3yorsQ

Shared the curry coconut shrimps and they were delicious! Also took an entree of accras which I found were a bit weird as the texture was different than what I'm normally used to. It was kinda bouncy...weird but ok tasting.

My friend then took the grio plate and I took to beef plate (cant remember the name). Although both plates were decent, my friend who is Haitian told me that you can pay under $10 at cantine in Montreal north and have double the portion and similar taste.

Nous avons opté pour un trio burger banquise + poutine + bière pour lui, et un poutine Rachel + side salade pour moi. C'était très bon bien évidemment (y compris le burger) et suuuuper copieux (très peu d'assiettes repartent vide des tables)! 
J'ai bcp apprécié l'originalité des différentes combinaisons possibles au niveau des poutines et la variété de la carte (vous y trouverez aussi des burgers, des sandwich et des salades). Seul leger bémol je dirais c'est un petit manque de sauce sur ma Poutine.

I went in to ask for my money back, they charged me for the same service twice (which was never provided).  Practically the first words out of the owner were, ""call 911.""  Yea....I was overcharged, asked for my money back, and have been being harassed from this company ever since!  They are claiming that I am lying about how many times I have even been there!  When in fact, their own stylists are lying about how many times they have done=screwed up my hair and are reporting it differently (OR NOT AT ALL) in their computers!  The first stylist I saw there was LENA=bad haircut!  I came in for it to be fixed by the most experienced person they had, which is what I had requested initially but they decided to give me Lena, with only 3 yrs experience.  After most experienced Sarah had fixed my haircut, I decided to let Sarah do another cut and also dye my hair.  BAD CHOICE!  I would have never had SARAH do my cut or dye again after the first screw up but instead of just giving me my money back like I requested they insisted on fixing it!  And, she did so again the 2nd time, and again the 3rd time!  She is the teacher there, so this is why I allowed it to be her to try to fix it instead of obviously going with a different stylist but since Sarah is the teacher there I figured I was getting the best they had to offer...YIKES!!!  I am obviously the idiot for assuming they actually knew how to do hair in any way at this salon...I take responsibility for being the idiot (I'M TOO NICE!) for allowing them to push me around instead of just refunding my money like I requested the first, second, and third times.  BUT NOW, THEY TOOK IT TOO FAR!  THEY ARE STEALING MY $210, NEVER PROVIDED THE SERVICE THEY HAVE NOW CHARGED ME TWICE FOR AND ON TOP OF THAT THEY ARE THREATENING ME WITH LAWSUITS AND WASTING TAXPAYERS' MONEY CALLING 911 FOR NO REASON OTHER THAN TO COVER UP THEIR OWN UGLY BUSINESS PRACTICES!  SECRETS HAIR SALON IS HORRIBLLE!!!!!!  I actually have it all written down in my calendar (& on my head:() (however, not one of these ""women"" will even listen to or try to help me-instead they just called 911!  The manager, Luann, (with the full support of her owner=evil!) threatened me on a voicemail that they would attempt to get their lawyers involved because I left a comment on Facebook so others will know that these ""women"" will NOT only screw up your hair and steal your money afterward, they are threatening your civil rights!!!!!  Freedom of speech, honesty, & integrity do not even exist in this salon!  And, they actually did call the cops on me and I had to talk to 2 cops when I showed up just for proof of where in their computers it says I have only seen Sarah 2 times!  When I have in reality seen her 4 times!!!!!!!!!!! 1 fix haircut after LENA originally screwed it up + 3 bad haircuts/dye jobs!  HERE R THE DATES: 2/12: bad haircut and dye job (from SARAH), 2/19 SARAH was supposed to fix instead yet another bad haircut and dye job from SARAH, 4/12 SARAH was supposed to fix but received yet another bad haircut & dye job from SARAH!  Of course I was charged the $100 ($65 dye + $35 cut) the first time Sarah did cut and dye (2/12), BUT for some reason she charged me another $110 (dye + cut + $10 gloss) on 4/12, but that was supposed to FIX the crap cut and color she had given me the first and second times!  NOW, THE TOP HALF OF MY HEAD IS BRASSY ORANGE WITH BRIGHT NEON YELLOW PATCHES/HIGHLIGHTS :( & THE REST OF MY HAIR IS AN UGLY ORANGE BROWN :(:(:(  I USED TO RECEIVE COMPLIMENTS ON MY HAIR EVERYWHERE I WENT UNTIL I STARTED COMING TO THIS SALON, NOW EVERYONE I SEE SAYS ""IT'S NOT TOOOO BAD:(""  I have seriously gotten the exact same haircut at Great Clips & Wal-Mart!!!!

The cheese curds are the most varied. The first time I had them (some years ago) they were absolutely perfect, and sometimes I've gone back to fine them very good, but usually they are just good. The cheese is fine, but the coating is not the perfect consistency - maybe it's a little too thick or not light enough. The beer and cocktails are ok. On this last visit, I had a blackberry cocktail of some kind that was way too hard and limey for my taste. I used to always order their mac and cheese, but it's way too inconsistent. Usually it just tastes like cheese product instead of cheese. Every so often the mac and cheese is delicious, though. On this last visit I had a mozzarella and tomato salad with grilled asparagus and red peppers. It was very good. But it was too big and when I took it home in their decomposable togo box, the wetness of the mozzarella meant that the mozzarella balls stuck to the paper container and came away with lots of paper. I'm glad that they are trying to be environmentally friendly with their take out containers, but it wasn't an ideal experience. The only thing that's consistently good here is the atmosphere - it's pretty noisy, but not overly so. It's always pretty busy which is fun.

FaCxpKgHPgUO9vqyOny5CA,3,2014-04-29 01:56:21,9,WOgA1sidII-iwfNIiyXg_A,"St. Viateur Bagel Shop proffers an admirable simplicity. Bagels (mostly sesame) are served warm from a giant metal sluice that sits next to a table where an aproned man whacks and shapes dough he then shoves, on large trays, into the oven (whence they spill forth via the sluice). There's a refrigerator case stocked with bagel-angled groceries: many varieties of cream cheese, two or three of capers, half a dozen smoked salmon options, and several salmon spreads; a few jams, butter, and some stuff we failed to note. There's another small refrigerator with non-alcoholic drinks. 

The drawback is that the bagels suck. 

""Suck"" is too strong, but we'd been advised that Montréal's bagel scene rivals New York's, and that turns out to be a lunatic's delusion. In flavor, this dough isn't far from a simple street pretzel. What a street pretzel has that these bagels lack, of course, is a thick pelt of salt. Any flavor you get at St. Viateur comes from that refrigerator. The bagels give you a warm smooshy vessel for salmon, cheese, jam, etc., thus fulfilling only the most rudimentary function of a bagel. 

It was late, though; we had played a show and everything else was closed; and so we fell onto the St. Viateur bagels like half-starved hyenas stumbling across an unguarded scrum of newborn kittens (must happen sometimes). Given the strictly-takeout nature of the spot, that meant huddling around a tiny ersatz picnic blanket of paper bags on the sidewalk out front, scooping and spreading cream cheese and sawing salmon with little plastic knives no stiffer than stir sticks. 

There's something attractive about the rudimetary nature of these bagels. Like inchoate little vertebrates crawling out of the sea on their journey to articulated limbs and teeth and wings, St. Viateur's product arouses in the modern mammal an instinctive gratitude. That's not to say, though, we'd ever elect willingly to shed our teeth and thumbs, our poppy seeds and garlic and swirls of pumpernickel.",3,RGydGY3TC2mfqQJOkxkDzw

There is one girl who works morning with curly hair, and if I always got her, I'd continue to go here, but every other employee I've encountered there needs to get out of customer service and quick.

On my first visit, I intended to order an iced caramel macchiato. The girl with the curly hair gave me a hot one. I couldn't remember for sure that I'd said iced, so I accepted it without comment. She thanked me, told me to have a nice day, smiled, handed me my drink and I was on my way.

On my second visit, I got the curly haired girl again. Very similar to my first visit except my drink was made like I wanted. I was happy.

On my third visit, I was in a hurry so I decided to skip the drive thru and go inside. I was actually in such a hurry that I just ordered iced coffee. The couple that had been in front of me got their drinks, so I thought I'd be on my way soon. The male half of the couple got the barista's attention to let him know the drink was made wrong. By this time, I realized I'd made a mistake by stopping because I was going to be late. So I got a female barista's attention (not the curly haired girl..she has straight, blondish gold hair) and told her that I had to go and I just didn't want them to worry about making my drink. I promise you I was in no way rude. It wasn't their fault that I was in a hurry. I was just planning on forfeiting the $3 I'd paid. The older guy behind her asked me if I'd had the iced coffee. He sounded aggravated. I said yes, so the girl made it quickly and gave it to me. She was also clearly annoyed. I thanked them thoroughly and told them that that was unexpected but appreciated. They didn't reply. 

My last visit was in the drive thru again. Again, they were very busy. I ordered an iced caramel macchiato again. The older guy was at the window this time. He handed me a hot caramel macchiato. Since I was certain I'd said iced, I nicely told him that I had ordered an iced one. He was obviously annoyed. He said ""oh"" and took it back. They then poured the hot one over ice and gave it back to me. No apology or ""thank you,"" Ora asking me if it was okay that they just poured the hot one over ice...just a ""here you go.""

I'm a little upset that the Travel Channel hyped it up so much on Man v. Food. They made it sound like the perfect sandwich. French fries AND cole slaw IN the sandwich, with meat (and tomatoes)? What's not to like about that?

Unfortunately, the best part about the sandwich was the cole slaw, which I actually really liked.
I ordered the pastrami and cheese, which is pastrami with cheese, tomatoes, cole slaw, and french fries. The meat wasn't bad. It's no Katz's, but I wasn't expecting it to be. It wasn't great either. It almost tasted like any other sliced pastrami I would get from the cold cuts section at a deli. The french fries were soggy and flavorless. The bread was super soft and could barely hold the cole slaw together, let along the rest of the ingredients. By the time I was a few bites in, the bread was already smushed and lost into the rest of the sammie.

My boyfriend ordered the Pitts-burger which boasts itself as its #2 seller, but nowhere on the menu does it say what #1 is. So I asked the waitress (who seemed like she hated life, or at least hated Primanti Brothers) what #1 was and she responded with the Pitts-burger. Makes no sense but okay. He went with it. The Pitts-burger is the same as my sandwich but instead of pastrami and cheese, it's a hamburger patty. An old-tasting hamburger patty. I'll leave it at that.

We also order two Pittsburgh beers. I forgot one of the names (but it tasted like Miller Lite), but the other one was called Steel City. I think this brewery might have taken its name too literally because it had an unpleasant metal aftertaste (to no fault of Primanti Bros, since it was bottled).

The only other thing I liked about this place (you know, besides the cole slaw), was the chili. It was a tad spicy but it was very flavorful. So if you do decide to come to Primanti Brothers, your best bet is probably to just stick with a cup of chili and a side of cole slaw.",8,hwSSM8Jn29dXRW4ym-roDQ

They nickel and dime every penny out of you.  I had to have some stuff replaced that I did not damage (shitty remodel job) but didn't see the point of paying to live in a place with broken tiles and a broken towel bar.  So I asked to have it fixed and was promptly billed for it.  The upstairs neighbor had a Chevy Volt electric car and the way the duplex was metered we split the bills down the middle.  So I was essentially paying for half of my neighbors fuel costs.  I complained and they gave me a $100 credit to shut me up and said ""he'll be moving out soon..."" The house only had one thermostat and the nice folks who live upstairs end up freezing all winter, but since the way it is wired and the fact that the property owner only wants money they won't put in a second thermostat or any kind of auxillary heat for the top floor and Mette H. (stay away) told me I was required to keep the heat at 74! I could go on and on about why you shouldn't rent from these profit hounds.. If you do make sure you cover your bases and be prepared to be really inconvenienced by all of it.  They are in this business not to serve you but to solely make as much money from you as they possibly can.  I bought a house half way through my lease and subletting is a nightmare and they offer you little to no guidance or help and now are trying to tell me that I owe more on top of my security deposit after move out for cleaning and removal of items in the basement that were not mine.  Profit hounds.. Just give them your routing number and they will gladly drain your checking, savings, and any accounts that hold your hard earned money in them.

Dad also had a 50% off coupon so ... score! Overall food is better than wedding banquet catering and the Steak was surprisingly great. Some dishes were a bit more on the salty side which I didn't mind, at least it was better than the blander dishes on their seasonal menu. But the most surprising dish of all was the sausage stuffing. It was actually super tasty and just the right thing I wanted for the holidays. Everything else was okay, and slightly above average. At its price, I think it offers great value for what you're paying.

The Decour of the restaurant is beautiful, and the location is perfect right in South Park. Also, all the sides we ordered with our meal were amazing.  But there were a few things that bothered me about our meal. First the service, our server was very nice and professional. I just wish he was a little more tentative to our table. I felt like I was constantly looking for him to order a drink.  Speaking of drinks, I ordered one of their specialty cocktails that the waiter recommended. It was very good just weak.  At $15 a pop, I'd like to taste the booze in my drink. 
Now on to the steak. I ordered the bone in aged ribeye medium. The first steak that came out was chard pretty bad and lacked flavor. The manager came over and offered to cook me another one. 20 minutes later a less chard steak came out. The second steak was a lot better and had some good flavor. It was just unfortunate that we were all done eating by the time it came out.  Overall, our dining experience was good just not great. And i feel that when you go to a high end steakhouse house everything should be great.  That's why you pay $15 cocktails and $60 steaks...",2,x8e1Cc1lh835Q1CpHAD0RQ

After the micro burst hit my area of the Valley two nights ago, I woke up to a hole in my back window with the rest shattered & barely intact.  I called Glass Now who stated they would be able to accommodate my needs same day, between 12-4pm.  I was ecstatic they offered to provide the replacement same day, and the quoted charge was extremely competitive.  

I set the appointment with Alex who was a friendly gentleman. About 30 minutes after setting the appointment at my home address I was called into the office due to a shortage of staff.  I called Alex and asked if this would be a problem, he told me it should be fine. I let him know if it was at all an issue to please call me, and I will head back home when the technician begins heading that direction.

At about 12:30pm I received a called from the technician stating he had been driving around my complex for a half hour looking for my car, waiting for the company to provide him with the right phone number to contact me.  I'm not sure why he was given the wrong number, or why it took a half hour to rectify the issue? The technician told me he was never given the updated address for my service.  When I asked if he could come to the new address(roughly 5 miles east on the same road) or if I could come to him, he replied ""No, sorry. I've already been waiting for a half hour.""  Well, how is it my fault you've been waiting for a half hour? This was his first time making any sort of contact with me. He stated he would call the office and have them contact me with a solution.

About an hour goes by, nothing. So I gave the office a call and Sonia answered. She had no idea who I was, or what the situation at hand was. After being put on hold she told me service could not be provided until tomorrow.  Although I was frustrated because my window was on the verge of shattering into my back seat, I said that was okay. What happened on my way home? My back window shattered into my car.

Today rolls around and I receive a call at about 9:30am from Sonia.  She told me they didn't have the molding for my window available, and would have to get it from the dealership tomorrow, leaving me with a service date of Friday 7/3.  For one, Alex told me the technician would come out and determine if I needed new molding. He told me that would be ""worst case"" and they should be able to use the existing molding on my vehicle.  I relayed that information to Sonia, who again put me on hold. When she picked the line back up she said that I'd have to use new molding from the dealership to ensure quality.  Why wasn't this stated in the beginning? Why did the owner tell me otherwise? Why did you set up TWO different service dates without having the molding in hand?

Anyway, I let Sonia know I'd need to take my business elsewhere to have this repair done today without all of these ridiculous errors and delays. Her initial response was ""But we have your window in stock. You'll probably have to wait for any other company to get the molding too"" - Maybe not word for word, but that's what she said.  I called another company after I hung up with Glass Now. The other company had the mold in stock, gave me the option to use my own, and has already installed and left my office within 4 hours from start to finish.",0,K7FNx8LEtcDC8Ctw3a1IwA

I was mislead by the location because of the picture but that is on me. The following is the complaint I will be submitting to the American Psychiatric Association for the treatment I received at her office:
I visited Dr. Saleha Baig's office on 9/19/17 at 4pm with an appointment time of 4:15. I knew I would need to fill out new patient paperwork so I arrived early. After completing the paperwork, I was waiting in the waiting room with about 4 other patients. Dr. Baig's office door was left open and I could clearly hear every conversation with every patient. This made me question her confidentiality of patient information but I was in need of a new doctor for a prescription refill so I continued to wait. After two hours of waiting I finally was called back to Dr. Baig's office. Her door was still left open when I came in but I was the last patient since it was just after 6pm. She proceeded to greet me and I began to tell her a bit about my background. Then she asked if I was still taking the medications (she said about five different medications) and I said no I had no idea what she was talking about and then she called me by the wrong patient last name and she realized I not only I was a completely different patient, but I was a brand new patient. She then immediately stood up and started yelling for her receptionist Diane. Diane then entered Dr. Baig's office and Dr. Baig was scolding her in front of me about not scheduling new patients at six o'clock. That is when the receptionist informed her that my appointment was at 4:15 and I had been waiting the whole time. Dr. Baig continued to scold her saying she could not have new patients after four and that the receptionist is overbooking her and this is unacceptable. I then told Dr. Baig she did not need to see me and I could find another doctor. Dr. Baig said I could stay and she would see me but continued to scold the receptionist, and explain that she would need to pray and then see me (I have no prejudice against anyone's beliefs or practices but this would have meant more waiting and I already felt like I was a burden to her at this point). I began to cry because the reason for my visit was a decline in my mental well being and overwhelming stress, in which this instance with Dr. Baig reprimanding her receptionist was causing me more stress. I asked the receptionist and Dr. Baig to destroy my file because I would be seeing a new doctor. About thirty minutes after I left I received a call from Dr. Baig's office and it was Dr. Baig herself. She apologized for acting in that matter, saying she had not used the restroom since the morning and she was very stressed out. I have this voicemail on my phone and I am willing to share it if needed. I find this extremely inappropriate to say as a mental health specialist, especially since I am a teacher and understand that I cannot blame my actions in front of a classroom of students for simple reasons such as not using the restroom. I felt all of Dr. Baig's actions were extremely inappropriate and now I am frantically trying to find a new mental health provider to refill my current prescription and now to help me overcome the stress of my current situation and the situation I encountered with Dr. Baig. As a mental health provider, Dr. Baig should be much more aware of her actions and the way she communicates with her staff, especially in front of a brand new patient. I will be making my insurance aware of Dr. Baig's behavior so that they may consider taking her off the list of in network providers because I would not want anyone else to have to endure that kind of behavior.

We picked up the car and terrible service felt like they don't want you there. As soon as they see a MAN wearing SUITS and looking like they have money they were all smiles and giggly even welcoming them and wishing them a great weekend. We rented through priceline which is a really good deal we got (i wished i read the reviews) THAT WASN't THE HORRIBLE PART, When we returned the car, i had my camera slightly below the passenger seat, i always hide it there especially if i live my Nikon D60 inside the ar, since the car was tinted just to make sure nobody could see it. But of course it ended up i forgot all about it when we got out the car, as THE GUY WAS CHECKING THE WHOLE CAR AND SEATS, he gave us our receipt and we started walking away from the car maybe after 20meters away i remembered my camera and I ran fast as i could, the car was at the parking spot they have which is still visible from where i stand so i ask them if i could check it, as soon asi opened the door camera wasn't there anymore and the seat was all the way back which is not the way i left it. Of course i started panicking and crying and the supervisor went up and asked me for details and if i was sure i left it in the car. At this time they were trying to locate the person who moved the car from point A to point B. Well after 15 mins they finally located the guy and then we saw the other guy who was checking the car when we dropped it leaving with his back pack, i wanted to ask to search the bag but i was just to weak and frustrated and not sure if i can really do that. So they claim theyre going to get the manager to go check at the cameras and it will take around 20mins. They said i could call the cops. and so i did but not really a help coz they said they don't respond to this kind of situations. So supervisor tells me they can't do anything about it coz ""just so to let you know we are not responsible for any lost"" Oh im well aware of that, but from point a to point B? Isn't that called theft? it's between the 2 guys that handled that car. So the worst part, WE WAITED 2hrs sitting there and workers kept telling us THEY're still looking at the surveillance camera. So i couldn't wait any longer, talked to the ""supervisor"" and she said ""YOU SHOULD TALK TO THE ADVANTAGE MANAGER"" while 2hrs earlier she was the updating me and telling me theyre going to look at the videos. So we walked back to the booth right by the exit and there you go a man that we didn't even see the whole morning telling us they searched the car and look at the videos and they didn't see anything. I asked him if i could see the video and he said i could't that he's ""sorry"" but they couldn't do anything about it, he didn't know who was the customers when we were by the end booth all this time thinking they are still looking at the videos.! We just wasted our time and didn't get my camera back. IM sure not all of the workers there are horrible people bec some of them even tried to help us but don't push your luck, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.",3,XXfJ8-KCy5m7s-XW6_zS9g

I have gone back from my initial visit, just for the ricotta toasts on a few occasions. Reservations are recommended in advance as it has gained much popularity in the last while. Be prepared that the music is quite alive, so no cozy first dates at this place. 

From the front door charm to the mixologists at the bar, the staff are truly on point. Now if I could only figure out what they do to the sweet and sour meat balls...They are incredible and I almost didn't try them as I'm a savoury type and the thought of 'sweet' didn't initially appeal. Seriously awesome. Grilled octopus is so nicely done as well!

Rh2smrKvcamnP8VBUgMI0Q,0,2016-07-17 20:38:25,0,KW2qsj1fGiNfVZNg6I1WeQ,"I'm hovering around a 3.8 - 4.0 after eating here.  Service was good only because the managers were hanging around the door where they have the small 1-2 people tables. Also their frying station, bussing/takeout/ hub area (?) was in the same area. 

Ha gow wrappers were moist thin & looked beautiful with visible pieces of real (whole large size shrimp) but entire dumpling was bland. No condiments on table like hot pepper paste or soy sauce which would've elevated this dumpling to phenomenal. It was so delicious & I would say perfectly seasoned when consumed cold (which I did with my leftovers later than evening) which is truly how one are supposedly able to tell if food is prepared well with the proper amount of seasonings

Steamed/boiled sowpea greens are good with the dipping sauce provided. 

Shrimp cheung fun & pork cheung fun tasted soft & freshly made.  Their soy sauce dressing was lighter (barely a light caramel soy sauce color) than I was used to in the NE USA corridor

Low baat guo (fried radish cakes) were okay.  The radish chunks were signify larger & somewhat tougher than I am used to. They were well charred but not crispy which was sad.  Again no dipping sauce was provided but they were really accommodating when asked (after they tried to tell me it doesn't need any sauces, they may have been correct on this one)

Siu mai were plumb, full of shrimp & pork/beef topped with a little red goji berry which added some herbal goodness & pop of color. 

The fu pei guen (steamed tofu roll) was what i say around waiting on & was sadly disappointed.  These rolls usually have meat & bamboo (maybe other junk like mushrooms,  water chestnuts etc) wrapped in a bean curd sheet. They made theirs with no bamboo but instead was like a pot pie with carrot, peas and celery... to say that my wait was disappointing was an understatement & severely impacted their rating.  

The ho fun was kinda disappointing.  Was more like thin ho fun with uneven soy sauce seasoning.  I could do better at home...

I was seated for a small table out of the carts' way.  70% made sure they were attentive to guests waving at them & came over to the small group area, but not the case with the popular items like hong gaow (chicken feet), rib tips,  etc. Akron to be fair,  after the first 2 times I did that,  they did come over if they saw me raise/wave  my arm.  This helped uplift their rating in my mind. 

I was also disappointed by the small selection of steamed cart dim sum. There were like 6 items available.   I didn't see tripe, short ribs, chive dumplings. I had to stop one of the managers & ask for my fu pei guen because they just don't have it available on their carts.  Another uplift to their rating? Attentive waiters who filled my water glass.


I've already recommended Dim Sum King to a friendly lady stranger I met who have been to another place like 10 doors down and tried to tell me about them,  but didn't know about Dim Sum King which had all day 9a - 9p $2.80 (s,m,l sizes) dim sum Monday though Fridays.",1,6UunqF-6SDRhN9Avx_Kh9w

Went through and ordered and paid for our food and grabbed one of the cleaner tables. The condiment containers are all pretty gross. I understand when a place is busy you can't necessarily get everything as sparkling as it maybe should be but the ketchup was dried and caked onto the bottle, that doesn't happen in a short while. Cleanliness aside, our server was pleasant and the food was pretty good. It wasn't the greatest burger and fries I've ever had but it was worth going back for. 

That said, the management/owners seem to treat their staff poorly. I watched several interactions with the servers that made me think this place runs like a prison. Asking for a to-go box became a problem for our server because apparently she had the audacity to give me one of the larger boxes instead of a smaller one. I've never seen so many people chastised for whatever they did wrong, out in the open during a rush. Seeing that turned me off pretty fast and you can see how their behavior changes the demeanor of the servers. Not sure if I'll be back but I doubt it.

Don't get me wrong, I do realize some restaurants go for a certain look, but hear me out for a second. They were all wearing dresses SO close to their rears, that I doubt they would even bend over. Walking in, the interior was EXTREMELY nice, and had me excited to be seated, but then I saw OUR seats. We were seated in the very back of the restaurant next to the kitchen. Our decor looked about 40 years older than the decor in the rest or the restaurant, and there were only four tables spaced evenly ONE FOOT APART. I was a little disappointed, but thought nothing of it -- seeing as I hadn't scanned the restaurant yet. I was lead to the bathroom by a waiter, and to my surprise the only part of the restaurant that wasn't eccentricly decorated was those four little tables in the back. I was EXTREMELY disappointed. I felt like yesterdays shell fish. I felt personally discriminated against for my weight, especially since the other three tables were of people the same size. I felt like we didn't fit ""their mold"", so they just stuck us in the back. I will never, ever, EVER, be coming here again, and will advise anyone not to either.

Last time I visited this place was before the remodel. The old setup (from what I can remember) was cramped, outdated, seemed even a bit rundown. However, since they remodeled it, it's more open, clean, and you don't feel shoved up against a wall or another table.

My parents have always raved about this place and I finally decided to give it another shot, and I will say that I'm impressed. Cheerful, and attentive staff, a nice clean and current atmosphere, and good food. Seating was quick and we were able to order right away.

I ended up getting the Belly Boy (I'm guessing it's their signature burger) with a side of fries. The menu was easy to navigate to find something that would fit your taste. Although it took a while for the food to actually arrive, it was fresh and delicious. The fries are similar to what you'd find at a fair. You receive plenty of them and they're spectacular. The sandwich seemed almost like a high quality Big Mac (minus the onions, extra bun, and extra patty). That's not a bad thing, it tasted great.

I went to the outlets specifically to get my nails done at LAKA.  I had been here once and had decent service and was talked into buying a card for 5 express manis.  Big mistake.  I've been back twice and had a horrible experience both times.  The last time I went I was assured that they could complete my 'express' manicure in the time frame I had.  Well I was there for 45 minutes for the express service and was late to my next meeting. Not to mention my nails had bubbles in them.  I went back again today because I still have 4 prepaid services.  When I walked up to the booth there was only 1 girl working and the manager (who I usually see standing around the booth) was no where to be seen.  They have a sign in sheet which you put your cell number and they call you when they're ready for you.  I signed in and asked the girl about how long it would be until she was ready. She said 5 minutes.  I wandered around some of the nearby stores waiting for a call.  After about 15 minutes and no phone call I walked back to see if she was ready; she was doing another person's nails.  I asked her what happened to the 5 minutes she had told me. She stared at me and said, ""Oh... (long pause) I thought you were coming back"".  I told her that I had planned on it but was waiting for a phone call, considering that's what the sign in sheet protocol says.  She again stared blankly at me and said, ""I thought you were coming back.""  After a few more questions about whether or not they follow their own protocol of calling customers per the sign in sheet I left, annoyed and without a manicure.  I will NOT be going back to LAKA.  I guess I'll lose out on the 4 remaining prepaid manis, but I should have checked the reviews before purchasing that card.  Save yourself the trouble and stress and spend the $5 extra for an actual salon.",2,KJbIThDzNdsSxIFK1eDQkw

A friend and I were in the mood for some brunch (and of course cocktails) and we knew exactly where to go for good quality and friendly service. This place is definitely a hole in the wall; a very clean, friendly, inviting, and fun-filled atmospheric hole in the wall. You can definitely expect a different kind of atmosphere for each meal-time of the day. 

I ordered a spicy bloody mary and the Po'boy shimp sandwich. Both were PERFECT! The bloody mary was spicy, but not overpowering and just the right amount of salty. The Po'boy was fresh, shrimp was cooked to perfection and soft. Definitely adding this to my favorite meals. Our waiter was friendly and on-point with his service. 

Brunch is generally quiet, but fast service and you will definitely be taken care of right away. Lunch is average, but not too packed. Dinner is where the action is at. The open area outside is always lively with live music (in the summer), fire pits, waterfalls, and a very well stocked bar. 

I would definitely recommend their Dark and Stormy mixed drink. It's ginger beer, lime, spiced rum. Out of this world delicious.

They ordered their beers and I let the waiter know that I needed a couple of more minutes because they have a really big beer list. He came back roughly 5 minutes later with their beer and as I was midsentence about to order my beer, he stormed off and walked away not even asking if I was ready. He Didn't come back to the table until roughly 5 to 7 minutes later. I ordered my beer and he was out of it so I ordered a different beer that he said he had. He came back to the table with a totally different beer that I didn't ask for. He said he was out of that beer that I asked for as well. What he should've done was come back to the table and ask me what I wanted instead of assuming what he thought I wanted. I ordered my next beer and he came back to the table with the original beer I asked for that he said he was out of in the first place. At this point I was fuming and there was nothing that was going to turn the service around. At the end of the night we asked for our check at three different occasions and still nothing.

We arrived a little earlier than our scheduled check in time of 3pm, and no room was ready which was to be expected, and not the issue. A man named Carlos spent quite a long time reserving us a room with two double beds in it. This was very important to us. We are literally here just for a Tough Mudder race the following morning, and need to have a good night's rest. 

Carlos was able to secure us the proper room. We left our bags with the lobby, and went to explore the city. Carlos said he would call us when the room was ready. 

Upon our return after the phone call, the front desk lady named Paulyne said there were no rooms with two beds available. I explained that Carlos had reserved it for us, and we asked to talk to him. Conveniently for them, Carlos was gone for the day. Not only was Carlos gone, but Paulyne said there was zero evidence or notes of anything Carlos might have done. Even though we literally sat there for 15 minutes while he fumbled around on his keyboard. I'd be shocked if the truth is really that he was doing absolutely nothing that whole time.

We tried to explain our situation to Pauline so she could understand how important it was that we get a good nights sleep, but she did not care about us at all. In fact, when I was mid sentence she walked away from the desk to talk to her friends and left me standing there. I've been in hotels all over the world and have never experienced anything like this.

We used to be regulars at the owner's previous spot and want to support a local restaurant. The food is worth going back for. The only reason I'm not rating 5 stars is for lack of service.

So sad it did because I wish I had my time and money back.  They need to send someone over to The Mint to see how tuna tartar should be made!  The price for the tuna tartar was $18 which I'd HAPPILY pay if it was GOOD but it was awful!  Instead of a nice bowl of tender delicious tuna like we had at The Mint, we got a tri-level blob on our plate.  The bottom layer was what I believe were crushed up chow mein noodles of some sort....bland and boring!  The next layer, which was about 3/4 of the blob, was guacamole....WEIRD!  And it wasn't even a nice bold flavorful guac!  Like the chow mein noodles, it was bland and boring.  Then in a VERY thin layer smeared on the top were some small pieces of raw tuna.  And guess what?  It was bland and boring too!  No surprise there, huh?  So we very disappointed to say the least.  We also opted to try the seared ahi tuna.  Another mistake!  I've eaten a LOT of ahi in my life (Salt Cellar always has beautiful ahi!!) and when I order seared ahi, I expect it to be put on a very hot grill for just a moment and then turned over for another moment and then off so that the inside is still nice and raw.  Everywhere I've had seared ahi from one side of the US to the other has been prepared that way.  At City Hall it was cooked all the way through and it really ruined it for me.  It almost seemed as if we were eating canned tuna.  Not impressed!  We would have complained to our server if we ever saw her!

El Hefe - You can instantly smell the jalapeño coming off the head, which is a very light one that dissipates quickly, so enjoy it while it lasts.  The beer starts like a hefeweizen and leaves a slight jalapeño heat on the back of your tongue to finish that disappears just as soon as your tongue picks it up.  This is a great beer if you like hefs and enjoy spicy things (I do).

Ba-Dunkle - Not very aromatic at all, ditto for head (where most the aroma comes from). It is a smooth, wheaty beer though. Not anything great, but a solid beer. It was my least favorite of the four.

Chocolate Victory - The head was nice and thick, and held up longer than the other four pours. This beer has a definite ""chocolate"" look (color) with toasty notes coming off the head. The nice toasty malt taste is balanced with just the right amount of hop bitterness. It had a creamy but smooth mouth feel. This was my favorite of the four.

Black Eye P.A. - Had some fruity hop notes off the head which contrasts nicely against  the dark color (you don't expect a beer that dark to smell that fruity). Both thick and creamy, it is just bitter enough to balance all that malt and not overly hoppy. I'm must say I'm not a fan of unimaginative IPAs, but I do love black IPAs because they have more character, and this is one has to be one of the best I've had.

They do sausages out front (different company) if you get hungry.  There is plenty of bar seating and table seating as well.  I know most people wanna walk up and down Fremont making noise, drinking macro-brews, and acting a fool.  I like sitting down at the end of Fremont, sipping my craft brew, relaxing to some good music and company.

I asked for the fillet, medium-well with double veggies instead of the potatoes. I got a 1/2 inch thick $30 hockey puck with overcooked broccoli that was black on the stems from mold. There was no sauce on the steak.
The other plates at the table all consisted of very over cooked food that was dry and plain. I am surprised no one became ill. It looked to have been cooked 5 hours prior to our arrival.

I feel like we literally see every server in the restaurant; whether it's bringing out chips or bringing our drinks or taking our order. That's what I call awesome; every server in the place should be just as focused on the other servers tables as they are on theirs to ensure everyone is always taken care of.

I paid a 200$ start up fee and now 33$ per month. My sales rep. was sociable and professional and I was comfortable with the arranged payment plan. But what does that money get me?

The gym is less then a year old so the equipment and building are new and clean. With the appalling exception of the showers. There seems to always be at least two that are out-of-order, and the grime on them makes no sense what so ever for the time they have been in use.

Condos have created an arms race in the form of amenities they offer their residences. With increased competition fitness centers have begun a similar war to draw clients. Below are the amenities the Markham LA fitness offers and does not offer.

Offers

Basket Ball court- Not a full court size and always packed

Spin room - Lots of nice new bikes

Personal Training - I have only been bothered once about doing a fitness assessment 

Pool - much like the basket ball court, it is available but more so just to say they have one. Its barely bigger then a waiting pool

Yoga/ fitness class - Have not attended myself but I see them going on regularly 

juice bar - over priced

kids center - if I were a parent I would be appreciative 

Does not offer

Squash courts - squash is available at some LA fitness but only with a premium membership usually 5$ extra pre month

olympic lifting platform, running track, towels

If they fire whoever is the maintenance manager and get the cleanliness of the washrooms up to par I would raise this review to a respectable 3 star. LA has some work to do over all if they want to compete with Goodlife and the YMCA.",2,jNuaw_2e5DYKPx-MRdUEOg

We started off with 3 orders of the chocolate dusted beignets, that arrived freshly fried to order with a side of two sauces: nutella and a rasberry jam. Fantastic. Fresh and airy, lightly dusted, and with sweet sauces (save the sauces for the bread you'll get later). Which by, the way, is also very good. 

We also ordered a variety of fresh baked goods. i went with the cheese danish (which was a little thicker than I was used to, but still fantastic with creamy cheese in the center), we also had the sticky buns, which was just ridiculously good. Not too dry, not too sweet, perfectly sticky.

Our table ordered a variety which included the Sourdough Waffles with Strawberry, the French Toast (signature dish), the chicken and waffles (with bacon infused batter, which basically tastes like cocaine), and the tuna salad sandwich. Everything was served with decent portions, well executed, clean, and very tasty. I found the sourdough waffles to be light and airy, served with strawberries that were sweet but with that hint of tart, so good that i didn't even have to put syrup on my waffles!

Although I found the prices to be a bit steep ($13 for mimosas and champagnes, although try the French 75 and the hibiscus champagne), we got out of there, with gratuity included, for about $40 a person. The entrees themselves are REALLY affordable, under $15 for most dishes (including $12 for french toast or waffles)

All in all, Bouchon is one of those splurge for fantastic food that borders on art experiences that define Vegas.

But a restaurant is more than its food, and countless times I have been disappointed by the poor service. In one situation, I was told there would be a fifteen minute wait (which could be remedied if I just ordered to go, at which point my food would be ready in fifteen mintues)--I ordered to go, was asked to wait outside, and after waiting twenty five minutes and inquiring as to the status of my order, I was rudely instructed to wait outside and my food would be brought out ""whenever it's ready.""

For a restaurant that had only six occupied tables including our own, the service was horrifyingly slow. It took 15 minutes for our miso soups to arrive, and another 20 minutes for three plates of sushi and a bento box to come. I asked how many rolls of dynamite rolls came in each bento and she said one. When it came, there were 8. Our waters were never refilled once for the hour or so that we'd been there. We waited for the server to attend to us once we were finished and give us the bill, which she never did. Instead, she avoided our table like the plague and attended to every table around us instead. It took three attempts to flag her down and it took 10 minutes for her to bring our bills, although we could all see her standing around, doing nothing. When it was time to pay, I had to do two separate transactions for my girlfriend because they couldn't put our bills together which didn't really bother me. I left her a 10% tip on each bill which I thought was too generous for being ignored by our incompetent server. 

Furthermore, our food was disgusting. We all received miso soups but my girlfriend ordered the bento and got a small bowl of soup with noodles that tasted like Mr. Noodles with spring onions. The miso had no taste whatsoever. The soya sauce was different, sweeter than the standard Kikko sauce, which did not go well with any of our sushi whatsoever. One friend and I ordered spider rolls and while I was impressed by the size of all of our portions, my excitement quickly diminished at the foods' tastes. Everything was sour. There was barely any crab in the roll, instead being filled 90% with rice. The dynamite rolls in the bento tasted sour too, and the shrimp had no taste. The pork cutlet, which I assumed would be served with katsu sauce, was drizzled with some sour brown sauce and, surprisingly, was not too bad. The gyozas were the best part of the meal and there were only two.

I told him I just purchased it at Jiffy Lube last month. He said is was the poorest installation he had ever seen. The battery is the incorrect size to fit my vehicle, and it was not properly strapped down. The incorrect size forced the wires to be stretched to their absolute maximum length and the movement of the battery caused the wires to dislodge, thus disconnecting my battery. The mechanic was able to splice the wires and solve the problem, but he warned me about what a HUGE safety hazard Jiffy Lube had put me in. So disappointing.

The baristas told me that the espresso beans are sourced from Familia Peixoto, just like their coffees, which has notes of hazelnut, honey, and berries. There was also bits of chocolate from the local chocolate shop, Zak's chocolate, in my drink, and it was love at first sip- it was seriously one of the best lattes I've had in my entire life! The flavors blended in a way that just made me smile - not too sweet, not too strong, it was just perfect, just smooth and delicious. And again, I have serious lived in places with serious caffeine addictions, and Peixoto's brews are definitely up there. 
I was so impressed, and so curious, and a little terrified, that Peixoto is so far from me that I'd never get to try it again that I ordered another latte, this time from the seasonal menu, the Matcha Mel latte. It was good, not as bitter as some matcha lattes can be, but I think I was still won over by my original order. 
After two regular lattes, I probably was high on caffeine, and there are so many things on the menu I want to come back for! This includes the seasonal Coco Latte that has condensed milk, the affogato with gelato, and the days they carry Welcome Chicken & Donuts, donuts.
I did hear they partnered with Urban Cookies so you can now pick up some brews in Phoenix, but I feel like I will make up some excuse to come over here again to Chandler.
Aside from their products themselves, the staff was extremely nice, friendly and knowledgeable. I learned that they source their beans from Brazil and are all fair trade. I love that they partner with other local food eateries, and even their matcha is supplied by Gotcha Matcha, another reputable source. Much respect and love for Peixoto coffee, I am sure you will see me again soon...",13,4ECIXWllFTxtJaj1cKOZWw
jsuUmIEefPjV__ads62Z5w,1,2014-07-31 06:17:12,3,7GfGziAPOfWZerzc4i3ljw,"This place is hard for me to understand let alone review. So I decided to go in the middle with three stars. I'm only going to touch briefly on the food. It's not really the reason I wanted to review this.  Get ready for a rambling of mixed feelings.

Some friends took me here on a Wednesday night around 7 PM. They have been here before and had nothing but good things to say about it. If they hadn't driven I don't know if I would have been able to find it. There isn't a sign above the door. I later found out this is on purpose. We walked in and the first thing I noticed was the small space and dim lighting. My friend explained to me that if you see a table then you take it. Otherwise you have to sit at the bar or wait for a table to open up. There aren't a lot of them, and the last one was taken by the party they walked in before us. So we ended up sitting at the bar. I don't mind bar seating though. Some places I actually prefer it and this seems like it would be one of them.

The bartender was very polite and attentive. He answered all of our questions and even offered samples of beer we were asking about. We split some kind of queso dip with spinach and chorizo in it. I was enjoying it a lot until I got a bite of something super spicy and I had to stop for a few minutes. I'm not exaggerating, it was painfully spicy. And not even the good kind of spicy; burning pain kind of spicy. I ordered a burger for my entree. It was a spiced burger with bacon, barbecue sauce, avocado, and a huge hunk of cheese. It was such a thick slice of cheese that it didn't even melt all the way through. I picked off the unmelted chunks and took my first bite. I cringed as the taste of burnt food filled my mouth. After closer inspection I discovered it was the bacon. It tasted like the residue from all the other food that had been cooked in that spot on the cooktop. So burnt bacon and unmelted cheese aside, the actual burger was just ok. It was seasoned nicely and not to greasy, but there was nothing extraordinary about it. I honestly expected more after all the hype from my friends and the bartender. The fries were delicious and crispy, but not a lot of places can screw up fries. My friends got meat skewers and a pasta dish. I didn't try either dish but they looked and smelled good. So the food was fine. Here comes the rant. 

I am always looking for a place that offers great costumer service. When I go to a restaurant I'm paying for not just a meal, but the staff that's making me feel like a valued guest. This place is adorable and trendy. It feels kind of like you're walking into an exclusive club where only the cool people can eat. I love that part if it. However I don't love the sense of pretentiousness that this place has. I was told they have a policy where they can turn away anyone with a less than totally understanding attitude. In a way this is beneficial to help keep the assholes away, but at the same time it's a service industry. They must be doing well enough that they don't care if people leave and never want to come back. They also don't split checks, and don't split plates. I feel that these are easy enough accommodations that should be made for your paying guests. I just didn't feel like a valued customer here. It felt more like they were just waiting for me to leave so that they can fill my seat with a regular that is going to drink all night. 

I think this is the thing that bothered me the most. One of the most important experiences in a restaurant is the service. If people don't get good service they don't want to return. The food wasn't good enough to outweigh the pretentious aura. I don't think I'll be returning.",5,ncugBamM3wXRNGcv-BR9mQ

My boyfriend ordered a vegan pizza (they use a non-soy vegan cheese) which he said was very good, but the crust left something to be desired.

*Peach Bellini- blended and not too sweet. Great breakfast drink. 

*Strawberry Sangria- this is too sweet; I wouldn't order this again.

*Sunday Night Pasta- pieces of short rib beef, with ground beef, mushrooms and onions in a thick red sauce over a bed of thin spaghetti noodles. Not your ordinary spaghetti. The sauce was a bit salty so I added Alfredo sauce to balance it out. After adding the Alfredo sauce and drops of Tabasco, this dish was pretty good.

They do have a daily happy hour and also I believe a reverse happy hour and all-day happy hour on Sundays. Over the years they have steadily increased the prices on their happy hour to make it not such a happy hour. Still a better deal than their regular menu.

Marketplace smiles is a rip-off and has the worst customer service and dentists I have ever experienced. I had many visits there and not once have I been greeted at the desk. Someone would just point to the clipboard and simply say you sign on there. ""well thanks, hello to you too."" The dentists constantly change and I'm always told they have left the practice. I never saw a dentist twice which takes away from a dentist getting to know you and your teeth situations.

I've had a crown which still hurts till this day due to it not being sanded down enough, I had an onlay that was not sealed correctly and because food kept getting in underneath causing bacteria, I had to have an emergency root canal. In other visits, I was told 2 teeth were cracked and  need crowns and that I should have my silver fillings changed. Well according to my current dentist, no cracks and no crowns needed after a thorough evaluation. The fillings are in fine shape and if I have no pain, leave it alone. My current dentist also said Onlays are a waste of time because it's a temporary fix which became the case in my situation. A crown is similar price and does the job. Onlays will be turned to crowns down the road so best to leave the middle man out and save the money. 

The geneticists do terrible periodontal cleanings and have many times tried to talk me into getting certain things that are not covered, but are supposedly beneficial because it's a new thing and works. I did try one special procedure out of curiosity which renews your gums by burning off the top lining. Well, didn't do anything special and was a waste of money in my opinion. They seem to not know what they were doing because of the many times having to stop and ask questions or because the cleanings were done so quickly. Periodontal cleanings are special cleanings and must be thorough. 

Last, but not least, this office has messed up on all billing done for me. Every claim was incorrect. They ask upfront for a large certain amount and then when the claim is processed, they don't let you know that you overpaid. I've had to call many times and the way they treat you when you let them know the claim is processed and I over paid is incredible. No apologies or remorse, but simply focusing on who's to blame.

El4FC8jcawUVgw_0EIcbaQ,3,2009-12-28 01:53:51,3,jolfpHyYjQ80i0IpKJEjnw,"I just got back from my trip on the week of Xmas and I ended up staying at the MGM. I have stayed here many times before as it has many things going for it.

Lets start off with the Pros:
1) I definitely like the location as it is right in the middle of the action. It is nice to be within walking distance of a lot of great hotels. Across from MGM you have NY NY and then either side of that you can go south towards Excalibur, Luxor, and Mandalay Bay. The treat this time is going north of NY NY, you run right into the new City Center with the Vdara and Aria hotels which just opened up about a week before. You definitely need to check out City Center at night with all the lights.
2) The standard rooms in the hotel are pretty good. Yes, the hotel is a little older that some of the others on the strip, but it is pretty well maintained. I ended up getting a room with a king sized bed and the there was plenty of room to sprawl 2 fairly large suitcases on the floor without it feeling crammed. The bed and pillows are comfortable and soft so it definitely makes getting a good night sleep (or small power naps in my case) easy.
3) The hidden gem to the MGM is the monorail. When you want to get further up the strip to party but you don't want to burn you energy on the walk up there, take the monorail. A day pass runs like about $14 and you can use it as many times as you want. Single ride passes are $5 each if you don't plan on using it more than 4 times in a given day. I usually always take the monorail and stop at Harrahs to get to the Venetian, Palazzo, and the Flamingo stop to get to Ceasars.
4) You can beat the price. I ended up staying here for about 50 a night. All I can say is coupon codes. There are everywhere and you usually get like a dinner, spa, or spending credit for staying. You take advantage of that say for a hang over breakfast to refuel for the next night and it can cut the price of each night into the 10-20s. Not bad.
5) It goes without saying... there is a hidden Fat Tuesdays in that small walkway to the parking garage. I hit up that place more times than I care to admit for good cheap drinks and having to just head to the lobby of my hotel to get it, is a huge plus for me =)

and the Cons:
1) It can take a while to check in and out. I don't think it is the staff as they always seem to get me in and out as fast as possible, but I think it might be the other ""special"" people that are slowing down the line. It may help to have more people on staff for check ins, but you only do it once so it isn't a big deal.
2) The walk from the self parking to the hotel with your luggage can be a drag sometimes. The elevator to bring you up to the exterior part of the main entrance near the lobby is slow and annoying when there are a lot of people waiting. If you pack light or feel adventurous with your large luggage, you can take it up the escalator of the stairs next to it.
3) The restaurants in the MGM are just OK. Craftsteak and Wichcraft are pretty good for a fair price. Everything else is either ""eh seen better"" or waaay to expensive for getting hammered the night before to appreciate the food.

Overall... I would definitely be staying here sometime in the future. Has more Pros than Cons and for the price, its a good deal. The way I see it, I am usually doing a beer crawl all night long.",4,cTf5rrUd253mkJtUW0DYKQ

You would think that would give us a pretty good chance of getting good service, but no, the service was terrible. The waitstaff managed to mess up not one but two special requests, and it took over an hour to get our entrees. With appetizers, the meal was an hour and a half affair. One of my biggest complaints was the salsa-- it was EXTREMELY watered down. The Pace salsa that I buy at Costco is better quality than their salsa.

This was my first time ever visiting a red lobster. I grew up on the coast, so when we wanted seafood red lobster was never a place that came to mind. That is until they announced their endless shrimp promotion! I love shrimp, so I figured if there was ever a good time to give red lobster a try this would be it. The service was pretty standard and comparable to any big chain restaurant, not outstanding but good. Now I can't comment on some of the other food they offer at red lobster but that endless shrimp promotion was amazing! They start you off with biscuits and a side salad. Then the entrée is any two types of shrimp and two sides. Now, at this point I was pretty full but being the shrimp lover that I am I had to keep muscling down more. Every few minutes our server would come over and ask what we wanted to try next and as advertised, the shrimp were endless they just kept bringing out more.  At the end of the meal, we had three boxes of leftover food to bring home! If stuffing your face like this wasn't such a health hazard, I would be there every night.",1,x8e1Cc1lh835Q1CpHAD0RQ

First off, the quality of the food has decreased significantly.  If you want good Mexican food, there are plenty of places to get it.  Likewise, the service in the cantina is weak.  I came in on a weekday for lunch, and there were not many customers in the cantina.  Still took almost 10 minutes to even get a waiter over, then another 10 to get a soda I had ordered. The table behind me was empty and sat unbussed for the entire 20 minutes, but the busboys walked by several times. I have worked in restaurants and I would have fired them for what I saw...

Once I got the food, it was okay, but I had to wait another 20 minutes to get a waiter's attention to get my check...

Final straw for me was going in today to watch football. I got in early to see where my game was showing.  They have signs on the TVs indicating which games were showing on each TV. Sat so I could see Raiders/Titans and Jags/Ravens. I was told in no uncertain terms that the TVs were not changing, and heard the bartender mention that as well.  But, before the 1st quarter was out, the games changed... So I could not see the games I wanted to see.

The burgers are a step above Burger King, but are less enjoyable than Red Robin. This last time we went, I was impressed with the service. It was a Friday evening and, even though their Facebook page said they were open until 9pm, they closed at 8. Lucky for us, we arrived shortly before 8 and the lonely cook got to work on the burgers. 

While we were waiting on our burgers, a few people approached to order and he explained that Barrel Burgers was closed for the night. Everyone seemed understanding enough and went on their merry way. All except one lady: she came back and curtly asked the cook, ""you seriously can't make 3 burgers?!"" He tried to explain to her, again, that they were closed. And again she insisted. He agreed. She then asked for some special organic topping. The poor guy had to go all the way to the back of the store to get it because he had already put it away. Keep in mind, this is all while our burgers are cooking. Then, when he asked if she wanted a bag, she declined because she and her two little girls were going to eat it there. Not ""there"" as in the dining area, but ""there"" as up at the bar area where he was going to be attempting to close down.

being honest. There was a surprisingly little amount of sauce and the pizza in general seemed to be overcooked as the cheese wasn't runny at all. The taste overall just wasn't great. I also had a salad to start which was just ok.

What a great restaurant! Every single dish was excellent. There was a live music performance around 8:30. That really added to the great atmosphere. I was here with my family, 7 of us. The music being sang had quite a few oldie throwbacks, so of course, my aunts and uncles were really into it and began singing along. It was great!

The arrival time of everyone had about a 30 minute gap and the waitress was respectful, seated us, and did not pressure us to order. We waited until the last person arrived before beginning our order. We began with some dips. There was a spinach dip, two eggplant dips, a walnut dip, and a yogurt dip. The eggplant dip was so delicious. I ate so much of the bread. I added the eggplant to the rice once the rice came out. 

Then came the salad. I did not try much of that because it was just regular salad and had olives. No thanks! Then came the soup. Mmmmmmm! It had little bits of carrot, celery, and was a thick barley soup. I love the food here because everything is SO delicious and SO healthy! Wish I could've grown another stomach for this meal. 

We got a sample platter of meats so that we could try a little bit of everything. There was very soft steak, then kebab beef (soft like what you find in gyros?) and chicken. Not a huge fan of chicken here, but ya got me. This is the place to eat chicken for sure. The grilled flavor is so rich. There are many spices working together, flavors my taste buds have never experienced before. We enjoyed this meat platter with the gloriously large plate of rice. Basmati rice with some butter spread over it. The yellow from the saffron along with another dark red/brown spice that was on the table. I am not sure what it is called, but it was zesty and my uncle said it lowers cholesterol. Delicious and great for your health. Why isn't there more of this food back home?

As I was struggling to fit all this food, the most amazing piece of lamb arrived at the table. It was so nicely prepared. The meat fell right off the bones as we shared it. It came in a little heat-proof plate, the kind fancy restaurants use to serve tiny portions of pasta. This piece was not grilled nor elaborately spiced. This was simple. I have never had such a soft piece of lamb meat until this point in time. 

As the night went on, service became a lot slower. It took a long time to get napkins and tea. Tea took 15-20 minutes to make. There was only 2 other tables in the entire restaurant...and it took so long to make little tea bags. I cant take a star off for that though, the food was really phenomenal. And for those of you who like healthy things, the sodas there are served in glass bottles which means there is no high fructose corn syrup in them. 

I definitely will save this location to come back to whenever I have the opportunity to visit Toronto again. 

There is some parking out front, but it is very limited.",8,w0W_hs1EX6x7XuZsEkHDDQ

In 2006, we purchased a brand new Sienna from this dealership and it was the best experience I've ever had with a dealership.  

Since then, we've taken the van there for our regular service work and even had a great experience when our automatic side door needed repair.  The person I worked with went out of their way to get us the expensive replacement part for free since we had been loyal customers, we just paid for the labor.  I've recommended this place many times and have bragged how happy I was with dealership. I had even planned on our next vehicle purchase coming from this place.

My problem is with the last time I took my vehicle to get service work done.  Our A/C stopped working and we took it in to hopefully get repaired along with our normal service work.  Their customer service is great as usual, but my problem is with this quote.

Replacement of A/C Compressor - Over $1900
Water pump and timing belt - Almost $800

I realize dealerships often cost more than taking it to a garage, but this quote is way too high.  I've researched average cost of this kind of service.  And have also looked at average estimates for dealers and auto shops from AutoMD.  

Maybe this is norm for dealerships now.  I've had friends who've suggested that these high quotes are to try and entice a new car sale.  I hate to feel that way, but now I'm starting to wonder.  I guess I'm feeling a little betrayed.",5,gjlhzR5eyMU-JVyeiuIeAw

Main (St. Rt. 59), in the old building of Firehouse Pub, Country Kitchen, and probably a dozen other failed restaurants. Based on my experience with an early dinner today, it will not be in business long. 

According to an October 9 article in the Record Courier, ""We're starting off with a small menu just to get out of the gate,"" Longhitano said, adding that current menu items also include burgers, salads and ""great Italian food.""  Indeed, a laminated single-page menu was on each table, with maybe 20 menu items including appetizers, sandwiches, salads, soups, and entrees. There were no pictures of their food.

When I arrived at 3:30 pm, there was only one table occupied by two older gentlemen. The waitress who sort of greeted me told me to have a seat anywhere. When she approached my table, I had my back to her and she started talking to me before she ever arrived at my table. I had to ask her if she was talking to me. When she returned to my table to take my order, again, she started talking before she even got to my table. Her enthusiasm was underwhelming.

When she asked to take my order, she didn't volunteer any information. I asked her to describe the lobster ravioli, and she held up her fingers to show the size of the ravioli and said it had lobster meat in it (well duh) and their alfredo sauce. I asked her if they made it themselves, and she said no. I asked her if it came with anything, and she said a side salad. I decided to try it, and I think it was the most expensive entree at $15.

When the salad arrived, it was just unwashed (I think) romaine lettuce with one cucumber slice, one tomato wedge with a big yellow stem portion in it, and some cheddar cheese on top. The unremarkable dressing was on the side in a plastic condiment cup. 

A gentleman brought the ravioli to my table. I'm guessing he may have been the owner, and he looked a little dirty and unkempt.  I tried the first ravioli, and it was barely warm. I tried the second, and it also was barely warm, so I set the plate aside to wait for my waitress to return. I eventually gave up on that and asked a second waitress to get her. Before she asked me what was wrong, she said ""cold""? That tells you something, doesn't it? They microwaved the plate, and the first bite was hot, but that was it. I didn't finish the meal.

The waitress charged me $8.99 for the appetizer version and did not charge me at all for the Pepsi. 

I have no plans to return. The attitude of the waitress was apathy, and if the staff doesn't care, why should I?",7,hDSeawZ10uiqU8lZk6knUg
CWy55lv2VVQo1jokYfnKtQ,2,2014-06-07 15:11:50,18,YPkK2YQnynXxZ-4C1ylQjQ,"I went to Jaudon for a scar revision and at our initial consult she talked me in to doing eyebrows in addition to the scar revision on my face.  When I arrived for my appnt., i waited over an hour.  I should have taken that as my sign to not use her, but I didn't.

She did my eyebrows first, which was hard to see at the time due to inflammation and redness, but it ultimately looked very fake, not like hair, but more like brown eyebrow pencil (last I checked I can do that!); color was too dark and arch was too high - so nothing about them did I like.  As I have thinning, graying eyebrows and was charged $400, I was very disappointed.  For my scar revision, after putting in 2 needles and just a few seconds, she said she had to stop because it swelled too much and since it was so small (1/4"" x 1.5"" scar) she couldn't see to finish and asked me to ""come back in about a week so I can finish"".  When i came back she took about 8-10 minutes to complete the revision.  Upon leaving, much to my surprise she charged me $200 on top of the $400 that i had already paid!  When i took issue, she said there are no ""free touchups"".  I explained this wasn't a touch up, but was a completion of the first visit and that I already paid $400 last week for the scar (she said she charges a minimum flat fee of $400 for scar revision, no matter how small).  I told her I had agreed to $400 and it was unfair to charge me more than what was agreed.  I explained that she must've forgotten that i had only a partial treatment on my last visit.  I could tell she wasn't listening to me as she was walking away and insisted that I actually should have been charged another $400 and that she had reduced it by half and that I should actually be happy.  Well, I certainly wasn't. Just horrible, unprofessional.  As she is only a contractor of the Parker Clinic, there is no one that she reports to to complain to; that's a bad structure since she can then do and charge whatever she wants. I'm not sure they realize how exorbitant her rates are.  They have doctor-conducted laser treatments that cost $400, but she feels she's worth $600 for 15 minutes work!  This  practice of unfairly charging and gouging her patients is very unprofessional and a poor reflection on the Parker Clinic to have her on staff, even if it is in a contractor capacity.  I would strongly recommend to find someone else.  The only reason i did not give her one star is that the scar revision turned out well, but should have been $200-300 for something that takes so little pigment and so little time.

So in the end I am out $1,000 and have a good, very tiny facial scar revision and a lousy set of dark eyebrows (she admitted the ink color was too dark and offered to revise them...for a fee, of course) Sad.  If anyone knows of a good cosmetic tattoo artist, please let me know.",29,ncWBFRIAnkoHHL3ANXx_Yg

We, my friend M, my (K) friend and I went there for dinner at 6:30 ish, on a Saturday night July 30, 2016, were greeted by her. It was K's birthday. She oyr server, was very open and accommodating, saying to the ladies lets start with drinks, when they were not sure, offered coffee, water etc, my wife said we were looking for Bellinis.  Amy, I found out, was her name, suggested several, so the choice was Peach instead of strawberry. Yum. I had the coke as designated driver.  Next was food. The list was great but I went for safe choice on food, just a regular burger? Wrong, it not regular, its big. It can be made with various choices. My friend took the fried egg as a topping, yes.  I had the Sauteed mushrooms as well.  Amy was good, asking questions like Yolk side up or down, etc, on my Burger I got multi grain bun.  I had wanted whole wheat but loved this choice.  M, ordered Chicken Quesadilla as a starter but woah, its huge, its a meal. Also it has lots and lots of Chicken in it. She has had it at some known restaurants, ie the One starting with D (Franchise chain, various locations) and a sports bar starting with S (named after sea fish) and neither of those have even 1/3 the amount of chicken in it,  Names of competitors were left out. It serves no reason to name them.  Dixon's out did everyone.  My Burger was better than that of Five Guys, Gal and Fries place.  I am thinking if this is their regular style of menu, I will be eating here more often.   Our total was under $70.00. 
Amy our server checked on us several times, refilling the drinks, Coke and coffee, offering Mayonnaise for fries for my friend.  She said it was her second shift so I was nervous on bill, you know  having to ask about corrections, no, I did not need it. When members of my party wanted to split bill, I refused, sent them to VLT's where they made money, Amy took it as a sign to give me the bill quickly, paid for it, so the others would not see bill.  Ralph, Wheres the Bill? Oops it got soaked then destroyed, but its paid so you cannot share bill, ha ha. Guys This is how its done.  Amy was so professional, so sweet and not using her looks to sell food. She told us about the different foods, how some of them tasted, how big they were. 
About us: I am a very cautious eater, always checking ingredients etc for dietary and medical reasons, M is a person whom loves to try foods, but nervous about prep, K is a seasoned restaurant food eater. 
I wrote this long review so you understand everything was awesome.  I will go there again soon and will post again so you can see its not a 1 time excellent dinner.  The tv at table had UFC on screen, so it was a topic of sorts, we did not like the matches but that's opinion. You could put menu in front of screen to block show.  I felt very good about tonight's dining experience.  I left full (stomach) from just the burger and fries, this was unusual. I had no space for the desert, Apple Pie, which is like a slab in size.

We've stayed at close to a dozen different Homewood Suites over the years and this one left us wishing we could have stayed at any of the others instead.

Furnishings were adequate but not terribly comfortable.  The living room had a sleeper sofa and a side chair, a dining table with two chairs, an end table, a coffee table, and a TV stand with 3 drawers plus the kitchenette, all in a room roughly 9' x 14'.

The bedroom contained a desk with 3 drawers (serving also as the dresser) and the bed and nightstands.  The desk also served as the TV stand, allowing a small work area and taking up so much room the door couldn't swing all the way open.

Our bedroom also contained the mystery deadbolted closet with unknown contents, which took up half the guest closet space.

The bathroom was large but dingy and dimly lit.

I considered renting an on-demand movie one evening, but everything offered by the hotel was $15+/each (!!) and since there wasn't a DVD player we didn't have the opportunity to rent somewhere more reasonable and bring it back to our room.  Free wifi seemed stable although a bit slow, and the pool was small but the kids didn't seem to mind.

The staff were very friendly and helpful, and the breakfast was well-prepared and always had enough variety to keep the kids and adults happy.

We got a great rate but hey, it's Scottsdale in the summer so most rates are pretty darn good.  Normally we enjoy staying away from home, but after 6 nights here even the kids were anxious to get home.

We'll stay at Homewood Suites again in the future, but not this one.",2,NKY-U-J1H4BMyWVWWuuYBw

We got there at 9:45, paid $5 for parking, (no line, lots of spots) were in and had seats under an umbrella by 10:15. By 11, I doubt you could get a shade spot, but lots of people did have tents, covers etc. on the grass areas all over the park.

Good things:

Wave pool was fun, kids loved it, even when it was busy

Lazy River was fun, nice break, lots of tubes or you can just swim it

Splash Island for the kids was great, slides for them (but adults could ride too) with maybe a 5 minute wait, lots of spraying, dumping, splashing water.

Bad things:

Waits for big slides were LONG. The kids only managed one (Royal Flush) and that took an hour and was the shortest line by far. They didn't want to wait for any others.

The whole stand in a long line for a tube, then stand in line for the slide is annoying. I guess if you rent a tube, you can bypass some of the tube lines, but you cannot bring a rental tube on a few of the slides. 

The ground everywhere, lines, etc. is hotter than you can possibly imagine. Shoes are an absolute must.

Food is expensive and so-so, but I find that to be typical of any water or theme park.

I should add that we didn't pay, got free tickets from a friend. If I had paid the $40, I would have been disappointed, (NOT worth it) but if you get a pass and go several time I think it becomes a better value. Also, if we were a MUST RIDE SLIDES family, I think it would have sucked with the lines.

The brakes were completely gone within a couple days of him buying it and he had to shell out extra money to get them replaced as they are brembo brakes (not cheap!).  While the brakes were being replaced (at Subaru), it was brought to our attention that the sway bar had broken because it was upside down! Carmax refused to cover the broken sway bar under the warranty because they said the sway bar would flip if taken over a jump and that was not warrantied. What a joke. Don't get me wrong, I love to do jumps in a car with no brakes, makes me feel alive - but this car was not jumped nor driven in such a way that the sway bar could've flipped. It was probably upside down because the previous owner that killed the brakes had some aftermarket junk on the car that he took off before trading the car in and since Carmax apparently doesn't look at sway bars and brakes while inspecting their vehicles, it just flew under the radar.

The joint has a gastropub atmosphere with a bar in the center of the room and tables surrounding it. The servers/bartenders are all extremely friendly and have always been very cordial. The cocktails are delicious and well made. The décor is hip and classy which I never thought I would say about a joint. It was a Monday and I pulled up a seat at the bar and was immediately presented with menus for my perusal. I can say that ive been here a few times now since my travel started to Pittsburgh and the combined food that I have ordered has been the Mac and Cheese, parpadelle, fried taters, wagyu strip steak, etc. 

The mac and cheese is really rich and even the appetizer portion is enough for a meal. If you love gooey cheese with special ingredients like brisket or lobster or foie gras, then this is your dish. There is nothing to hate about it. The parpadelle is another mouth pleaser and out of this world. The meat is perfectly tender and amazing with the sauce and pasta being the perfect compliment. I am personally a bigger fan of the dirty pasta over at butcher and the rye but this dish is a close second. The fried taters is a fancy way of saying French fries and boy do they deliver on it. This dish is a solid sharing plate for a few folks. The wagyu is the only one that I was not 100% a fan of. To me, it seemed like trying to put a fancy ""Asian"" spin and the sauce was a bit too heavy and overpowered the juiciness of the steak making it seem like it was in the passenger seat. Still solid dish but a slight disappointment amidst the other dishes that I am a big fan of. 

All in all, a great joint and a spot that I visit frequently. Love the service, the food, and the vibe. Definitely recommending to any folks trying to find a solid spot.",6,3Av38uh8aHDvZMV_1eojQA

When they would drop off extra plates or waters they just slammed it on the table in front of us without saying a word, and walked away. 

Also, don't sit on the patio. We were pooped on three times from birds in the tree shading the patio.

Similar to other reviewers, my favorite is the Enokitake mushroom skewer and Korean Cabbage. My family did not enjoy any of the meat skewers.

We just returned from a Birthday trip for my daughter... we had four rooms at Bally's. The two rooms that were in the ""old tower"" were entirely unacceptable. They were not only old and tired but filthy and in total disrepair. One room even had a bloody hand print on the wall! Dirty linens, stained carpets, marred furniture, stained bathroom amenities, the list is long. We went to the front desk to see about changing a room and were told they were totally sold out so no other rooms available. Then, when I offered a tip, the nice young lady said, ""well I can probably find one but it will be an extra $75 per night"". When I told her that was ridiculous, considering they were already paying $250 per night, she kindly reduced the upgrade fee to $40 per night. How funny that she miraculously found a room! Extortion just like the old Mob days!

We had our choice of two free rooms at any Caesar's property and chose Bally's only because it was less expensive for those who had to pay. We will never make that mistake again. You could not pay me to stay there again.

The gambling was the worst I've experienced in my 30 years of experience. I don't expect to get rich but a simple return once in a while would have been reasonable. I didn't believe the horrible gambler reviews online about this place buy now I understand and agree.

The only decent thing about this hotel is its location. However, there are so many better choices in the area and price range. One bright spot - A couple of the staff members were very nice, particularly the lady at the Diamond Desk.

This being my first visit to this location I expected around the same enjoyment.  Let me start by saying the service and the restaurant were both excellent.  Clean restaurant that wasn't cluttered and had a great overall ambiance.

The menu had several choices and for a woodfire pizza place certain items seemed out of place.  A lot of seafood and greek style apps.  ""Tapas"" had a spot on the menu and consisted of things like Artichoke dip and Edamame??? Ok, not Firefly tapas for sure but still small plates... I guess.  The woodfire pizza that stuck out to me was the prosciutto.  At Settebello its my favorite so I figured I would compare.

No comparison needed, Settebello's prosciutto kills what I just ate.  The pizza wasn't terrible but it wasn't great in the same sense.  Little chunks of prosciutto and an over abundance of artichoke and green onion to mask the flavor of the prosciutto.  Also, if you look and the photo I uploaded you can tell there are way too many green onions on a couple of pieces than others.

For those movie fans out there, you all know from Casino with De Niro and Pesci ""you need an equal amount of blueberries in each muffin"" hahaha.

Then she would repeat the whole routine again and after the song ended she asked if i wanted another.  I passed.  It was kind of weird/awkward.

Its  a 'create your own stir fry' kinna place where you get to pick a combo of rice, noodles, veggies, meat, and numerous flavors of sauces/seasoning, which are all in turn cooked together. You also get to add naan/paratha/eggs etc. The paratha here is awesome, but also a bit too greasy (which is probably why it tastes so good). Although the downside of this concept is that, you can never get the same taste again. It lacks consistency. You might find the food delicious one day and unappetizing/insipid the other day. Whats more frustrating is that you cant even blame it on the cook :), because you picked the ingredients yourself. The chances that you might be disappointed by the food here are quite high when compared to restaurants where you know a particular item tastes good and tastes the same all the time.

I liked my meal.  I had the gumbo soup, a great baked potato with lots of fixings, a sort of chocolate cheesecake dessert that was great.  My husband didn't like his meal.  My husband ordered a $50 steak that was fatty and gristley.  I could tell he was bummed when he poked around at his steak with furrowed eyebrows, cutting off piece after piece of inedible meat.

  I was really hoping to please him since it was his birthday.  I let them know when I made the reservations well in advance that it was his birthday and we didn't get a birthday dessert or anything free like you do at most other restaurants.  They remembered it was his birthday, the hostess (who was pleasant and very friendly) gave him a cheery happy birthday as we were going to be seated.  I really expect a little something special if we are spending our special day at their establishment.

  The waitstaff was prompt and friendly.  They seemed to linger around and dive right in when you need a refill on your drink, or in my case another great martini.  I almost forgot to mention that I loved their martinis.

1. The service.... I have to say I was pleased at the effort made by the service department to diagnose a fatal problem with my older car. Another GMC dealer tried again and again to fix, but had completely misdiagnosed the problem. When the true cause was discovered...blown head gaskets, my older car now was done / too old to spend mucho bucks to fix. This led to.....
2. My wife & I decided it was time to trade in both cars for 2 new cars. She a 2015 Mazda 6, and after a lot of looking, I bought a 2013 Ford Taurus Limited. Both cars are excellent except the Ford didn't have navigation built in as promised to me by our salesman Carl who also promised buying me a second key for the used Ford.

What brings my number of stars down from 4.5 to 3 (actually 2.5) is the purchase experience (nightmare) with Mike & Ted. the next day we were told that the bank denied the loan percentage and that we would have to pay more. 

We went in and heard the same B.S. story as other buyers have written about. 

IF A BUSINESS HAS FAITH IN THEIR PRODUCT AND PEOPLE, THEY SHOULD BE UP FRONT ABOUT WHAT A THIRD PARTY (the Bank) COULD DO TO SCREW UP THE PURCHASE!

If they just had the nuggets to say so and prepare us for what the bank may say would have been fine. Instead they hid behind mumbo jumbo and said we could accept the banks counter offer or leave the keys.

After looking both Ted and Mike eye to eye, I let them know that their lies and deceit countered all the talk about them being customer orientated. Ted had a practiced stare back, but Mike couldn't look me in the eye....we had them redo the contract so there was still no change in the monthly payment. A very poor way to end a business transaction....

And Carl?? He disappeared only to be told almost a month later that he had quit. He seemed to be quite nomadic, as many cars salesmen tend to be.

You decide whether you want to go through the same experience as we and others did if you wanna buy a car here. From all the reviews of so many other dealerships....this seems par for the course in Vegas",1,ih7Dmu7wZpKVwlBRbakJOQ

When we arrived, the entire first floor was empty...apparently they were only serving people  on the second floor. We get up and are told to sit wherever we'd like. After sitting down, we are asked if we can sit at another table, because they would like to sit a group of 4 using one of the tables. We look through the beer menu and choose a beer. We then look through their very limited food menu and choose. As soon as my coworker says what he would like, she says they are out of it. He then quickly chooses to avoid an even longer wait time. We both go with a sandwich with a side salad. When the food arrives, he ends up with fries instead of the salad. Little did he know, he lucked out. This was the worst salad I have ever had. Without being informed, I was given a beet, kale, and pinto bean salad. When the check comes, we ask to split it down the middle, but because of the very loud music, she does not here this request.

I came here on a Wednesday night and the place was pretty busy. First you start by choosing your size and base of the ice cream. You can get a single scoop, double or a nitro shake. Then you pick from their signature premium, organic, sorbet and coconut for the base. Second you pick the flavor of ice cream you want. Third you chose your topping and upgrades. I ordered a singe scoop of their signature premium, cookie butter ice cream topped with captain crunch and upgraded to have it served in a waffle bowl. The waffle bowl they used was really thin and soft. I liked that it was easy to break off and eat with the ice cream. This place is definitely a fun place to come and grab ice cream because they use the liquid nitrogen to make the ice cream right in front of you. When you see the smoke coming out of the machine , it's hard not to look in amazement and oooh and ahh as the ice cream is being made fresh. The ice cream was super creamy and rich, compared to the ice creams you get elsewhere . Overall the ice cream was good, good service, place was clean and I liked how the ice cream is made fresh right in front of you.

Price: $120 (with 25% discount on their site)
Length: 90 mins

Seats: It would be helpful if the rest of the yelpers include their seating in their reviews! But yea we got MIDDLE SEATS in the house babyyy!! Awesomenesssssss. I was afraid that upper orchestra (Section 201-205) would be too far away from the stage but it's not! If you really want to be close, then get the highest seats in lower orchestra. Trust me, you do not want to be tooo close because you won't get to see EVERYTHING. 

Price: I tried my best to look for a great deal but it was tough finding one. I just went ahead and booked mine through the Bellagio and later found out they have 25% off! Even though it says no refund/exchange but I called in for an upgrade and they gave it to me anyway! The original price for our seats would have been $165 but it was only $120 with 25% off! NEATO.

O: I think I had too much expectation for this show so it wasn't that great like I thought. Now you know, just because it's the most expensive show, it may not be the best. I still think Le Reve is better for some odd reasons! I mean O is good and all but it got a bit repetitive toward the end. Some of my favorite parts were the fire and swing performance. I don't know how they did it but the guy's body was on fire the whole time! And they did an amazing job with the swinging back and forth, though 1 person did drop. -__- Ohh and the clowns were funny! ""ayyydzaaaa"" hahahah that was hilarious! 

Just FYI: If you get limited views for upper orchestra between Section 201-205, it's because of the side rails that will block you. You definitely don't want to pick limited view seats for section 101 & 105...my friends sat there before and she said it was hurting her neck! Yes..it's really THAT CLOSE.",5,wQY6P6-1mlRBza7PpNtCag

Here's the background.  We decided to have a wedding party at our house this Summer, since our wedding was a private one in the Keys.  We spent a lot of time scheduling and planning this party, and several of our family members flew across the country to attend.

I suppose I should have known better, but what can I say?  We decided to go with Hy-Vee's catering service as they had a nice-looking menu and brochure, and the store manager (Lucas Glasgow) assured us that Stephanie's catering department is second-to-none.

Here's how the catering process was communicated to us.  First, we were to choose from a basic menu (we chose barbecue), and then could add the sides that we wanted.  Having done that, we were informed that Stephanie would call us the week before to confirm the number of guests and if any particulars had changed.  Great.

Unfortunately, Stephanie never called us back!  Being very concerned, we visited the catering department to make sure our service was still scheduled.  The first time, we were simply told that Stephanie was out, and to try back the next day.  My wife did check back the next day:  Stephanie was gone on vacation, returning after our party.  Not that this is a problem; we certainly understand vacations and as long as a backup is in place, there's really no concern.

Upon our 3rd visit, we discovered there was really no backup.  This is now Friday, the day before our party!!!  My wife, being the wonderful and reliable person that she is, went to find someone in the market since the service desk was completely unhelpful.  And indeed she did find someone, who was preparing our barbecue.  That's right:  cooking the meat the night before.  Now, anyone who knows barbecue can tell you that's NOT a good sign.

The party comes.  All the guests are assembled and having a very good time.  Hy-Vee shows up, and sets up the barbecue and sides on our kitchen bar.  Upon opening up the meats, it's clear they are overcooked and dry.  Completely terrible; tough, dried out meats that are difficult to even chew through.  Our guests, being the kindhearted and gracious people that they are, never complained to us of course.  But we were mortified.  It seriously ruined our party for us -- the very special day that we painstakingly planned for months.  Afterwards, we received a $100 discount (after some haggling), but that's not the point is it?

Please.  If you are considering Hy-Vee's catering, I respectfully ask you to re-consider.  We don't want this to happen to anyone else.  I wouldn't have taken the time to write this unless I was completely devastated by something.  Maybe you will get lucky, I don't know.  But if you hire these people, you are playing with fire.",10,zLQLIbLlD3SDdNzvrUqCGQ

Nigiri: 0/5 I hate when I go places and they give me a chunk of rice and a super thin slice of fish. The portions are so off here, the reason why sushi restaurants pack on the rice is to clearly fill you up so you don't get to fully use their all you can eat. Also the fish here isn't very fresh, I might even say dry at times. 

Rolls: 2/5  I usually don't order rolls but my boyfriend does, they have a pretty good amount of variety on their menu but nothing really screams ""OMG I have to try this"" and once again they packed their rolls with a lot of rice. Also I think they make the rice way way before hand so when we ended up getting our sushi roll order the rice was dry and crunchy huge turn off.

After he opened his Strip District business Peace Love & Little Donuts this summer, which has the trademarked slogan, ""Feed your inner hippie,"" someone found his blog. The online forum is titled, ""As I was saying ...,"" and it has a subtitle of ""Observations and interests from a middle-aged man fighting for truth, justice and the American Way.""

Mr. Razete is sticking by his right-wing opinions but he is upset that people are judging his business by his views.

The day that President Obama was inaugurated he wrote, ""This crowd will not rest until Homosexuality is mainstream; until the Second Amendment is done away with; until abortion on demand is as common and accepted as going to the dentist; until sexual images and strip clubs line our streets and suburbs; until government education is started in the womb; until disagreement with their political party is 'hate speech' and becomes a crime; until they pass the Fairness Doctrine and rid the country of Conservative talk radio; until they transfer our sovereignty to the UN, etc. etc. etc.""

Later, on Facebook, he referred to gays and lesbians as an ""immoral minority,"" a comment he still stands by. He also said he thinks ""about 85 percent of America is very misdirected.""

Sue Kerr, the author of the Pittsburgh Lesbian Correspondents blog, said it wasn't what he was saying that upset her; she has heard it all before. The problem she has is that Mr. Razete's marketing message doesn't match his political views.

She said it was the whole ""peace"" and ""love"" thing that attracted her to the business but she found his political views to be the opposite of the sort of live-and-let-live message that his business seemed to espouse.

Burger Legend offered their signature burger, The Great One, for $5...plus a free drink with a check-in on Facebook.

The restaurant is small and the decor is very minimal. With a few tables and bar stools, they also have three TVs (now playing the FIFA World Cup games). The cashier was very friendly and quick to take our orders. We waited about 20 minutes for the food. Even though we had a table, each order came in individual paper bags, which I find was quite wasteful.

Fresh Canadian beef patty, maple-smoked bacon, mixed greens (a.k.a. a bit of lettuce), tomatoes, and Bawss sauce. I really liked the thick slice of bacon, while the bun and beef patty tasted fresh. But overall, I did not find the burger was anything special. My friends and I thought the patty was quite small, too. For $5, it was all right, but I'm not sure it's worth the usual $9 for such a simple burger. 

We also ordered a large maple-smoked bacon poutine. The fries were soggy with a generous amount of cheese curds and gravy. I was disappointed to see how little bacon was added... (The maple-smoked bacon was truly the highlight of last night's meal.)

All things considered, it's nice to have a burger joint in Streetsville -- another great option when you are in the area. I am not a fan of The Great One, but I wouldn't mind giving their other burgers a try.",4,SRA86Xyf9fbOAhICWttMLQ

With their happy hours from 4 pm to 8 pm everyday, it's definitely worth checking out the Blue Martini!  We arrived shortly after 6 pm on a weekday and grabbed a coveted table outside on the patio.  

All their specialty martinis and wines are half-priced, as well as everything on the menu!  (Desserts included!)  What a steal!

The BF ordered the Down & Dirty (Ketel One Vodka and Olive Juice served with Three Large Olives) and I had the Bellini (Ketel One Vodka, Peach Schnapps, House Champagne, and a splash of Orange juice).  They bring the shaker to you and pour it tableside, which I think is great.  Not only does the waitress not have to worry about balancing the delicate martini glass, but you don't have to worry about trying to drink from a very full glass.  They average about to $7-$8 each during HH.

We started off with the St. Louis Style Spinach & Artichoke Dip (Spinach & Artichokes Mixed with a St. Louis Provel Cheese Sauce, Topped with Parmesan and Served Hot with Toasted Pita Triangles).  Like Mr N. mentioned, the pita chips are rock hard.  I'm not sure if they are intentionally supposed to be this hard, but they could soften them up a bit!  A pretty decent order for the price you're paying and pretty good too.

I had the Chicken Quattro Formaggi (8oz. Lightly Breaded Seasoned Chicken Breast Stuffed with Four Cheeses (Asiago, Parmesan, Mozzarella, & Provolone) served with Seasoned Rice, Marinated Artichoke Hearts Accompanied by a Roasted Red Pepper Sauce), which is odd since I don't usually like to order chicken breast.  I think the whole 'stuffed with four cheeses' got my attention and that's what sold me.  I had to ask for more sauce so the chicken had more flavor.  The accompanying artichoke hearts and greens lightened up the meal.  The BF enjoyed my dish.

The BF scored a winner with the Miniature Martini Lamb Chops (8oz. of Mint Marinated Rack of Lamb served with Seasoned Rice).  They were so moist and tasty, not gamey at all!  We had to ask for more of the green sauce because it tasted so good!  I wish I ordered this instead!  We'd definitely go back for this dish alone!

It's pretty chill hanging out there in the evenings.  It gets super packed though, so good luck trying to score a table if you come with a large party.  You can always grab seating inside, but it's pretty dark in there in my opinion.  And yes, there are a lot of fake tans, pretty boys in their shades and 'roids.  An amusing place to people watch if anything.

I have to agree with Myke R. about the restrooms being way too far.  Coming from the patio, it's a trek to meander yourself around the tables and crowds just to pee and wash up.  (I did see Allison J. though on my way to the loo!)

Overall, Blue Martini is a pretty cool place to hang out during happy hour.  I don't think I'd want to fight the crowds though during weekends and nights since this place fills up.  They do check ID, so no kiddies in here at all.  

Update! 05/31/08 - Went back for HH on a Friday night and this place is PACKED!  

* Seared Tuna (Sushi grade ahi tuna resting on a nest of asian seaweed and calamari salad, served with asian sesame dressing and wasabi.)  I'm not a big fan of seared tuna, but the seaweed, ginger, and calamari combo definitely added a nice contrast.

* Bruschetta (Fresh Diced Roma Tomatoes Marinated with Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Garlic and Basil Served on Toasted Sliced Bread Rounds Topped with Parmigiano Reggiano Cheese)  Nothing special, pretty basic that anyone could make at home.

I also tried a couple of their flatbreads.  By the time I got to it, It had been sitting out for awhile, so they were not hot as they should be.  Probably tastes a lot better when you eat them right away.

* Mango Madness (Finlandia Mango Vodka, Mango Schnapps, a splash of Pineapple juice) So so good!  A bunch of people from our group was drinking this and we all loved it!  A definite fave of the house, even for guys!

The restaurant is conveniently located in Shops at Don Mills, and the decor is absolutely beautiful. It has a high ceiling and some pillars that provide a very classy, but modern atmosphere.

I visited the restaurant along with three coworkers for lunch on a Friday. My coworker told me that the restaurant is not usually busy, but maybe because it was a Friday, we were not seated immediately (the wait was only about five minutes). Unfortunately, we were unaware that there was a closet for our coats until we saw a server open it and hang a customer's coat after we were already seated for some time. We would have liked it if the server told us about the closet instead of having us find out ourselves.

Overall, the service was great, but the food took a while to arrive. We waited for about 30 minutes for our food. We only had an hour for lunch, so we were pretty tight on time. Make sure that you have plenty of time to sit at the restaurant during a busy Friday period and even reserve a table if possible.

My coworker and I got the Royal Pad Thai. I really liked the presentation of the dish because the pad thai itself is inside an egg wrap. The sweet and sour elements were delicious, but I have had better pad thai at other restaurants before. Linda Modern Thai prides itself of its ""award-winning"" pad thai, but I just didn't think that the flavour justified a high price of $18. Regardless, the noodles tasted great, but I found the chicken a bit dry and hard to chew.

My other coworker got the Tom Yum Goong (hot and sour soup), and she was slightly unimpressed because she was expecting it to be more creamy. Linda serves it with a clear broth, which is a different version of Tom Yum Goong that other restaurants may serve. She also felt that the soup smelled like cleaning supplies, which was not very appetizing. She also got the entree size mango salad, but she wasn't full after eating it.

My fourth coworker got the golden curry with crispy beef. He didn't have any complaints for his curry. In fact, he really enjoyed it. However, he noted that even though he asked for the spiciness level to be the highest, he felt that it was definitely less spicy than Srirarcha sauce.

I would certainly visit Linda Modern Thai again because the food has great flavours, but I would like to try the curry instead. In addition, I would only visit the restaurant if I had time to spare.",3,l3lzPkbXKguqvO85rblTJw

Yes I live in McKenzie, but there's no bias - just sheer luck to have a great sushi place in the neighbourhood. I'd drive long distances if needed, glad I can just walk in.

Service is the best part of the experience - these guys are genuine, attentive, polite, and just fun to deal with - always smiling, friendly, jumping in to fulfil every need you may possibly have.

Good menu. I guess I've eaten all of it back and forth, and would love to see more items on it, but still - good stuff, enough to choose from for a while.

Needless to say, I've been to Haru almost every other weekend for more than a year, and neither me nor my wife had ever encounter something that won't be fresh and carefully prepared. We love that.

Another big plus is that Haru folks are so accommodating - when we arrive with our little one, they always help moving a stroller so it won't bother anyone, and give us a table which allows stuffing the baby seat in.

And the most important, it's not just about us, our family - we regularly observe the same level of respect and attention to the rest of the customers.

We recently were in Italy and had AMAZING pizza there, but thought this place could at least come close based on what I read. And we were right! Not quite as good as authentic Italian pizza, but pretty dang close. Wood-fired and made to order, the add-ons of prosciutto and buffalo mozzarella were worth it. The glass of wine was a little pricey for the size, but it was a nice house-red. The cannolis were nothing special, but the husband enjoyed the specialty dessert of a graham cracker cake. 
I do wish they listed the size of the pizza on the menu board. We were not aware of the size and ordered 1 to split. They are small enough that 1 is a enough for one person, and we probably could have gotten our own. 
I do love that they offer take-out and if I lived any closer, that could be very dangerous for my wallet with the prices they offer.

It was nice that they were pre-cut, but was it really necessary to pour a whole shaker of salt on it?? 

One of my friends unfortunately got food poisoning at the buffet, most likely from the sushi (the only thing he ate that we didn't) which spoiled our evening because he needed to be near a bathroom.

I was VERY upset at their dessert selection. All of the cream/mousses tasted watered down, everything had the wrong texture or taste and there was only one decent dessert. It was this nutella in a cone with some orange on it. But it is pretty hard to go wrong when there's nutella. 

Even though the price was decent for a dinner buffet, with other buffet options available in vegas, Bellagio's dinner buffet is definitely not worth trying.",0,rPUvTJryMnT7D_5HCqWvzw

However, during the performance, I was ignored as if I were a contagious disease, all of them made sure that to go around me, since they already had my money, why to pay attention to the gay... I was completely humiliated. And I just read a tweeting that they support the LGBT community after Orlando, please spare the LGBT community, and do not pretend you care.

They placed us in the middle of construction parking in the back corner, site 128, and we woke up to a bunch of construction workers pressure washing their vehicles at 630a followed by non-stop back up alarms, bulldozers, and diesel trucks idling outside our door. To top off the stay they shut off the water to the RV park in the morning. When we asked at the front desk about these issues they stated ""it's posted in the park, you should have known better"" about the water and when they called the now open RV park office and were told they shouldn't have placed us in the construction parking area the front desk staff turned to us and stated ""because you checked in after 8pm there is no way we could have known not to use the construction spots, we can't do anything about that."" We found this ""posting"" they referred to, it was a sheet of paper taped to the laundry room door in the RV area. So I suppose had we done laundry in the closed RV park office after arriving at 9pm we would have known we paid for an RV camp with no water.

I lived in Japan for a while, and enjoyed sushi there very much, but I'm not a picky gourmet eater or anything and find most of American style sushi pretty decent, though entirely ""different"" from what I'm used to in Japan. 

I went to the place for all you can eat lunch deal (which was actually restricted to 10 tiny orders total, but whateva). I don't know about regular menu items, but their portions were ridiculously small (one piece instead of normal two for each nigiri order, and tiny 4 pieces for each maki order). I can see they're trying to pretty-fy (trendy-fy or whatever the words you can come up with) their sushis, but especially makis were easy-to-make cheater dish anyway (which you never see served in a restaurant in Japan), so it's kind of funny they try to make those look ""high class"" by making them ridiculously small.

Another thing I'd never understand (not just this place but all sushi places I've been to in the US) is that they serves those cheap fake crab-flavored fish-meat substitutes as ""crabs"". Really, do they expect anybody actually thinks there's any crab in those things? If you can't afford real crab, why not just skip it from the menu, or at least clarify it being fake on the menu? I've gotten used to this fake advertisements in sushi menus in various places by now, but it's still surprising to see them proudly served in a supposedly posh place like Pisces. My order of ""crab"" nigiri sushi came with a piece of rectangular fake crab meat placed on top of a ball of rice. Do you seriously call this a sushi?

All in all, it was OK. You can find better (and cheaper) sushis even in Charlotte. I won't name names since I don't wanna sound like plugging the places.

On the plus side, the waiters were very cheerful and attentive. All in all, I think it's a nice trendy place to hang out. Just don't expect too much in terms of food or its cost performance.",1,aKqbihULk7vD2Fl9gMCzlg

oKZPgeCOxnVSxudYcn1OtQ,0,2015-01-03,0,py7Tm3YVLmHhu1YYm9K5og,"I went here for new years eve dinner with my parents and my fiance. It was a prix fixe menu for 70 dollars that came to over 90 including tax and tip...before wine. 

There was one vegetarian choice per course, which is expected and totally fine when it is 3-4 choices per course. The vegetarian choices sounded good and I was really excited before going. 

So, the first course was a caprese salad with one very generous slab of Buffalo mozzarella, one slice of red tomato (a vine tomato I think), and one slice of yellow tomato. The tomatoes weren't great, but it is winter and they're out of season. The dressing was a flavorless olive oil and thin balsamic vinegar, and one leaf of basil. It was okay but would have been greatly improved by smoking the tomatoes, or infusing the oil, or even just using a high quality flavourful olive oil...or more basil. Or even slicing the cheese thinner.

Second course was ""crispy ricotta gnocchi."" This was where it really fell apart. They were battered and over cooked so it was just like hollow, deep fried batter, none of the tender pillows of ricotta gnocchi I'm used to with this dish. It was also over salted and just incredibly greasy...this coming from someone who loves salty french fries or onion rings. I couldn't finish them. The portion was also ridiculously small (I know gnocchi is always a smaller portion but these were mini gnocchi and only came as 8-10 pearl sized balls of grease) and I was really jealous of my non vegetarian dining partners who had plates of fresh pasta, but again, I couldn't finish them anyway. 

I was really looking forward to the third course, risotto funghi, with 4 kinds of mushrooms, because I love mushrooms and was really hungry and already disappointed in the meal. Unfortunately it was the worst course of the night for me. It tasted like campbells mushroom soup that someone had added *extra* salt too. There were clumps of the rice stuck together. The different mushrooms which I picked out all tasted exactly the same, with the same texture, as they'd been overcooked in this mess. There was one whole clove of garlic, but the garlic flavours hadn't penetrated the rest of the dish. It was seriously awful, and my whole table agreed it was inedible. I was really jealous of the sides everyone else's meals came with, like wilted greens. They said theirs was okay but the steaks they request medium rare were unevenly cooked and medium well done that medium rare. There were some generous slices of parmesan on top of the risotto though, and that was the highlight of my meal. 

It isn't like me to not be able to eat my food. I've been to many amazing Italian restaurants in Toronto, Italy, and other countries. I also eat at malls and cafeterias and 7-11. This food wouldn't have been good even if I were drunk (and I did get drunk on all the wine, since I was on an empty stomach as the food they served me was inedible). 

Everyone else enjoyed their food, but were a little disappointed as nothing was outstanding or particularly good quality. It seemed to be a case of them not caring about vegetarian food at all, or maybe their chefs don't know how to work with flavours other than just using meat. The over salting was really jarring. I love salt, but this was disgusting.

Overall, it was one of the very worst meals I have ever been served and the price was outrageous for something I'd be angry and being served at a local pub.

We stopped one of the hosts asking if we had a waiter and he curtly replied ""I'm working on that."" No apology, no sense of hospitality. There were also some staff members arranging and rearranging empty tables and place settings and they did so without acknowledging any customers. A few minutes later one of them came to take drink orders and, again, there was no acknowledgement for how long we had been waiting.

I dunno, it wasn't all that. 

Located in the Miracle Mile Shops in planet Hollywood, and open all day.  Claim to have ""the worlds best lobster roll"".  I have to disagree, and this is based on taste, type of meat, and possibly luck.  

Maybe I was unlucky to get an off-night lobster roll.  It was filled with claw meat, didn't get too much tail in my roll.  It's very lightly dressed, and while that may be a ploy to say,""we're not going to hide our fresh lobster taste!"" what it ended up doing was make it painfully obvious that the roll was drenched in butter.  Lobster rolls I'm used to are more like lobster salad on bread.  And when I said filled, I didn't mean filled like bursting at the seams, I just meant that's what thye filled my sandwich with.  The bread to lobster meat ratio was something like 3:1, and it was tourist priced as heck, actually everything is here.

My wife got the lobsicle and the lobster ice cream.  I would describe the lobsicle as a split lobster tail tempura skewered and fried.  And the lobster ice cream was just a mild vanilla-ish ice cream with lobster meat.  It was ridiculous, like $5 for a small.  Don't get me wrong, I like weird Filipino ice cream, with corn and with cheese, but this just wasn't for me.  

I'll eat here again maybe, but I probably won't get the lobster roll.  I'd probably just get the lobster and chips, but more likely, I'd save my appetite and my skrilla for Boiling Crab or Hot n Juicy.",1,tQOVsJoOYwoPMIGkkPIfDA

They also ran out of plastic cutlery and I was told that our server would be bringing them to our table. Unfortunately the same lady at the cash brought us our food and failed to bring us cutlery.

Waiter came to our table very loud and obnoxious asking for our order... Didn't greet us... Didn't introduce himself.... NOTHING!!!! 
I ordered a half pitcher of Sangria and the Lobster Ravioli for myself. 
My Ravioli came out after about 40mins. and I thought that was a bit too long of a wait considering the place was nowhere near packed. It was very bland and it looked far from appealing. However, the taste was decent but I guarantee I could have found it in the frozen section of my grocery. 
They bring vegetables, house fries (potato chips), and cold bread also.
Veggies are definitely from a frozen and the chips have absolutely no flavor. 
The Sangria gets an A+ from me which is surprising because im not even a drinker.

2. Bfast options were listed, but bfast sandwiches were not. Also, bread options & bagel types are not listed. 
3. To be called a deli, the bread options are terrible. Cheap loaf bread. The bagel was tough to chew. Seriously....If we are paying this much for a sandwich, where is the good bread??

First, as others have noted, you will blow a day with an appointment. The wait has always been over an hour and that's just to get into the examination office where you will wait ANOTHER hour before the doctor comes in. It's incredible how disorganized they are. Next, they might send in an intern ""disguised"" as the doctor who will do a full exam only to learn you have to wait for the real doctor to come in and do the exam (AGAIN)! The lack of communication and patient-centeredness is second to none. They do not ""walk you through the process, communicate with you through surgery, explain what you might experience"" or give you the kind of feedback you would expect from any medical establishment. Following surgery, I asked the office staff a question and was told they'd consult with the physician and they'd call me back...they never did.

We ordered the Hafa Adai plate and Beef plate then sat down. It took about 15-20 minutes to receive our food. First of all, they gave us the BBQ chicken plate instead of the Beef plate we ordered. Upon opening the box, we were hoping it to be fresh and hot because it took quite a bit of time to ""cook"" but it was just warm food. 

The red rice overall was a pretty good recipe but I've had better. The texture and tenderness of the chicken kelaguen was good but I felt like they completely overpowered it with lemon, as if I was eating a lemon warhead. Comparing the two plates and the given the price, the portions of meat given was small. On top of that, the meat lacked flavor, was not tender and poorly marinated. The filling of the empanada seemed to be drenched in oil and greasy. The thing I did enjoy was the finadene, which added flavor to the main entree meat. 

Overall the service was something I did expect in Guam. A very genuinely nice ambiance. The owners as well as their employees were very kind and hospitable. It made me feel like I was back on the island!  

If they were able to focus just more on the flavor and taste of the food, they would have a very good restaurant. To sum it all up the food was okay, but the Guam vibe made up for the experience!

I was at the Westin 2 weeks prior, which was amazing and a very great experience. So I thought hey for my friends birthday coming up more people are coming I want to get an even better place so the Omni I thought would be great and it's right next to epicenter were made reservations at Flemings...

we took pictures of how disgusting the room looked! There was a cockroach wing, not in a corner, but in an obvious position on the middle of the floor. The chair in the room was extremely dirty and stained. I stayed at the Westin just 2 weeks before and the Omni couldn't even hold a candle to that place. I have no idea why they are considered a nice hotel? It is THE worst room I have ever stayed in ever. 
There is NOTHING modern about the hotel, there is a difference in vintage style and just plain and out of date. The last time I saw a bathroom this small and out of date was spring break in Panama city and that was a cheap last minute hotel we had to take but at least it was right on the beach. I don't care how close this is to epicenter, it's NOT worth the price.
We had friends from out of town that just couldn't believe how gross the room was. We only stayed one night. Thank God!

December 2015 we were looking for a tree service to get an out of control tree in our front yard under control, and saw a Hayward team working on trees in the neighborhood, check them out on Yelp, and had them out to for an estimate, it was suggested that the tree should be thinned out, and balanced, partly because we had been hacking away at the tree over the years trying to keep it off the house. Service was completed and we were impressed with all aspects of the service.
Well here we are at the end of 2016 and thinking we should work more on thinning and shaping the tree in the front, and to our surprise we got a call from Hayward on Wednesday, they came out on Thursday for an estimate since we wanted three trees in the back yard worked on, and a Queen Palm removed.

So I live close by here and I have tried this restaurant a few times and never had the best experience but after today I have given up all hope. I went to have lunch there with my friend and when we walked in the hostess was just looking around and so we waited in the doorway for a second and then I said ""hi there"", again she was doing nothing but looking around.. So I finally said ""hi, 2 please"" and she did not even respond, she just picked up menus and so we followed her to our table. Then we sat at our table for I'm not even joking atleast 10 mins. We saw 6 girl servers walking around the almost empty restaurant and none of them ever acknowledged us. I would have gone to ask the hostess if we had a server but she so clearly hated her job that I knew she would be no help. Finally the pack of 6 servers were standing together and I hear one of them go ""who has that table"" and all the girls just look at each other. One of them finally comes up to our table and says sorry she was caught up outside and she will be our server. We give her our drink order and ask to order our food now as well. (Obviously we were ready to order since we had just been starring at our menus for 15 minutes). The server did not seem happy about this. So we order an appetizer and our entrées and the girl walked away. After about 5 minutes a different server comes and drops off our drinks. And later a different server brings our appetizer while our server is following behind her with our entrées. While it was nice that our food came out quick, we would have obviously wanted a little time to enjoy the appetizer so our entrées wouldn't have to sit there and get cold. Our server never came back the entire time that we ate, both of our drinks were empty. The food there is spicy, so obviously you want a drink while you're eating. The server finally came back at the end when we were almost done with all of our food and asked if we were ready for the checks, never even offering to give us refills. Overall it was just a horrible experience. The staff there either just hate their jobs or don't care at all about having a sense of urgency... also maybe the servers should just have an inside or outside section, not both considering they can't seem to remember where all their tables are.

sKA6EOpxvBtCg7Ipuhl1RQ,19,2017-12-10 08:39:37,11,sPCDtsZXoCSSLuCbZNxb9w,"The first revolving sushi restaurant in Las Vegas has arrived and I love it! I've seen the concept before on T.V. in Japan and I thought how convenient! However, this place does not sacrifice quality for novelty. It is actually functional and practical. Let me tell you more.

Right when you walk in, you will notice the modern decor and cleanliness of the restaurant. Textured walls with warm lighting gave way to a sleek stainless steel conveyor belt  displaying a menagerie of covered plates of sushi. I was greeted right away and asked to write my name down for the waiting list. There was quite a few people waiting ahead of me, but it wasn't too bad. There was a mixed crowd of couples, friends in pairs, large groups, and every age group imaginable. I love how this new concept is bringing everyone together to have some great food easily. It wasn't before long before my name was called and I was seated along side the belt. Rows of food with a name sign right before it rolls towards you and you can just pick it off and set it on your table. The owner came by to go over how the conveyor belt works and showed me how to order other kitchen items on the iPad. He was incredibly helpful, patient, and hard working. He also explained that all of the rotating plate items are on a 30 minute timer, so after 30 minutes the unsold plate automatically gets kicked out and is not served. The fish served is also flown in daily. Hooray for freshness! 

All the white plates on the conveyor belt has a set price so it is easy to keep track of how much you are going to spend by how many plates you stack up. So if you get pick happy, your tab can run as high as your plates! The special kitchen items on the iPad ranges from single hand rolls, to ramen bowls, full sushi rolls, desserts, appetizers ( like marinated pork belly ) and more of things I can't pronounce but I am sure to try in the future. If you order items from the iPad, the robot Roomba looking thing on top of the conveyor belt will roll out to you, flash some lights, and tell you your food is ready. You just pick up your dish and then it goes back in the kitchen area! So simple, but I just love it! I ordered the soft shell crab, tuna taco, yellowfin taco, and pork belly just to have it come out. Yes, I was amused by the robot, but a robot that brings me my food is a robot that makes sense. All of the sushi was really fresh. No fishiness or mushy textures. Just clean and bright flavors.  They are not big on putting mayo and creamy sauce in everything, do for once you can actually taste the quality of the fish you are eating. However, if you are into that yum yum sauce and the like you can find something on the iPad menu. The ramen noodle soup was brought out by a real person so that it won't spill. Smart. The soft shell crab was ok, not as soft as I wanted, but everything else was top notch. One of my favorites was the yellowfin taco. Firm and meaty with the crispy wonton taco shell. It was the perfect two bite tuna delight for me.

Service was really good and I think for being open on their sixth day, they are doing a great job. Everyone was working really hard and moving very fast. The owner was even helping  out with the tables and refilling drinks. The dedication and pride really shows in the product and how good the place looks. I think the growing popularity of this spot will only make them busier. I have no doubt that with the continued passion of the owner, chef, and workers of this new sushi concept in Vegas that this place will be a success. I will definitely be back and highly recommend.",27,yyDp7MZ2st7p0fOQuFYpcA

The woman transferred me to Chris who I assume is the manager. He was the rudest man I've ever had to deal with. Instead of taking responsibility for the mistake and apologizing, he goes on and on about how I should have called Tuesday, not Friday. Really?? Who notices things like the peg to reset a speedometer?! So he says I should have noticed it and brought it back right away and doesn't know what he can do about it at this point.

First, it is $11.99 for brunch, but hey, that doesn't include beverages.  What buffet brunch charges you extra for non-alcoholic beverages?

When you find out that there is an extra charge, it is too late.  You are already seated at the table.  Why? Because your menu makes it clear that there is an extra charge, right there, in bold, in red.  It's just that the 100 or so signs surrounding the hotel offering the $11.99 brunch conveniently don't mention that fact. 

Did I mention the entire buffet line is about 15 feet long? Yes, that's how many options you have in total, about 15.  

Bally's may have once been a decent casino, but it has had to resort to fraud to get customers in.  Truly sad.

I decided to go with it since the interior needed to be cleaned too. They take my vehicle into the bay and begin the assessment of the fluids. One of the guys come out and shows me the transmission fluid stating it needed to be changed. I bought the vehicle a year ago and have never done it. Transmission fluid should be changed about every 60K miles. With the mileage I have it was due for a change. He told me it would be $99 but there was a $25 off coupon for the oil change and transmission flush combo. I told him to do it since it seemed like a good deal.

He called over to the cashier and told her I needed the $20 off combo coupon. She then says they didn't have a $20 off combo but only $10 (now we've gone from $25 off before the work was done to $10). I was about 4 people back in the line hearing this.

The swing is only a $15 difference and the transmission needed to be done but the fact that I was mislead and lied to is unacceptable. 

 I have been coming here for years since I live near it but will look elsewhere for future needs. Too bad too because the location is very convenient.

There's been a lot of hype around the dishes served here, so I as well others at my table were eager to try some of the items on their ""Enchantment Under the Sea"" menu along with some pizza. Sadly the service fell flat and some of the dishes seriously lacked seasoning which surprised us all. Our waitress, Krysten, didn't check on us much and all of our drinks sat empty for a majority of the meal. Flagging her down was a real chore and I can't figure out why such a popular place would have only 2 servers working on a Friday night?!

Suicide Fries ($5.50 for small portion) - Hot pepper blend, habanero garlic sauce and plenty of jalepenos piled on a bed of fries. This was featured on Food Network's DDD. The small portion was very generous and well worth the price. I honestly only sniffed the plate as it was being passed down the table for everyone to try lol and my nostrils started burning, so I just kept that plate moving along and am glad I did as those who tried it said they had a burning sensation in their mouths. I think a dollop of sour cream could be useful on the top of these fries to help with the burn.  

Poutine ($5.50 for small portion) - Fresh mozzarella and in-house beef gravy over a good amount of fries. I was really excited to try this dish and was quickly let down after the first bite. This dish was lacking in the seasoning department. The gravy and mozzarella were both bland. Fantastic portion for the price, but seriously needing better flavor. 

Braised Short Rib Stroganoff ($14.95) - Short rib, mushrooms, sour cream, beef jus, porcini and truffle powders over egg noodles. Yet another dish that was majorly lacking seasoning. When we were able to finally flag our server down to ask for some salt, that seemed to help the dish some. I expected the short rib to stand out more and just wasn't impressed with this dish like I had hoped. 

Naked City (1/4 sheet $14.95) - Pepperoni, hot Italian sausage, roasted sweet peppers, white onion, green olives on top of red sauce and mozzarella. Ours had everything except for olives per one persons request. The 1/4 sheet comes with 6 square slices and all of the toppings tasted so good together. My hubby really liked this one and we'd both order it again. 

The Guinea (1/4 sheet $14.95) - Grandma's meatballs, spinach, ricotta, white garlic sauce and mozzarella. This was featured on Food Network's DDD. This was one cheesy pizza and was well liked by everyone. By far my favorite of the night. I like the think crust and would for sure order this again.

I'd return for pizza and most likely order it to-go. They also have a brunch menu that I wouldn't mind checking out in the future with hopes that service can be better than it was this last time.",54,Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA

I was a bit disappointed with my recent visit here.  The thing that made me this disappointed was that they replaced their 'hubcaps' with 'lug-nuts.'  Sad Face.  Instead of crusted fried to prefect ion goodness, you now get lumped overly cooked crusting blandness.  Can't really get a garlic taste out of that.  It's not hard to process those tiny potatoes into the goodness they once were.  However, I still ate them.

This journey we had a nice seat outside to take advantage of the beautiful weather.  The waitress was on point and able to give some good tips on the food.  I opted for the breakfast burger with the lug-nuts.  My drink of choice this time around was a wonderful mix of Corona, orange juice and hot sauce with a hot spice rim around the cup.  The breakfast burger was amazing, egg, bacon, cheese, all that goodness between two pieces of Texas toast.  Really made me feel like I was sitting outside an old gas station with all that grease dripping onto the plate.

I love the decor in the place, the trunk on the rack over the bar really does remind you that it is an old gas/service station.  The awesome aroma from the wood fire grill however brings you back to reality to let you know it's an ass kicking place to eat.",1,ACwBMSJzgW6vOvV7vOrk8Q

I recently moved to Vegas & have been to at least 5 salons looking for someone who can do acrylics that don't discolor, are thin, natural-looking & don't lift.   I've had so many bad  fills that I had nothing to lose trying Flamingo.  

Tina really took the time w/ my nails getting the old mis-shapen acrylic down & did a BEAUTIFUL job w/ the fill. They are very natural-looking (no funky humped up nail bed), nice & thin and the white is pure white. 

The salon isn't fancy & the day I was in there were only 2 techs working (Hannah & Tina) but those two were very busy & I STRONGLY recommend an appointment.  Over the hour & half I was there, they turned away 3 people because they were already booked past regular closing time (yes, they booked an appointment after hours so very customer-oriented). 

Prices are what I am used to from the east coast...$35 for a fill so not cheap like I think people expect due to the number of places around town, but not the crazy $55 I paid at another salon (check my reviews).
