I ordered a bacon, egg, and cheese crepe (maybe it was sausage, egg, and cheese, I don't remember, my girlfriend and I ordered both anyway), and was pleased with it. While I openly admit I'd rather have an omelette over a crepe, I was full after my breakfast here. We went here early enough in the morning to avoid any sort of line, so maybe that's why I don't at all hate this place. My crepe *was* lacking a little bit of salt or ""oomph"" because it *was* slightly bland, but they did have some Sriracha that I could have put on my crepe -- I just didn't for some dumb reason.

Of course, they also have breakfast/dessert crepes. My girlfriend's mom ordered a Nutella crepe and said it was way too sweet. I didn't try any, but that's because I much prefer savory over sweet for breakfast... or anytime, really.

48th and Crepe has a small but pretty good menu. I definitely didn't love the place (because like I said, I'm not big on crepes), but it was tasty and I was full afterwards. I think that warrants four stars.",1,rFeXxtCeAGtWNdDWEu9I2A

Sure the huevos rancheros aren't entirely authentic, but they're still great. I like the sweet potato hashbrowns, french toast and pancakes. The chorizo and sausage they use is delicious (from Grateful Growers, I believe).

I purchased a ""used"" motorcycle on a Tues afternoon and paid cash. I paid a little more here since my impression is that they did a great job at going over the bike to ensure they were selling a good condition bike. I have in the past purchased used from a private party and have had a mechanic check things over just to make sure everything is on the up and up. Unfortunately I assumed being a large shop they would be reputable and not seeing any negative issues with the BBB I went ahead a purchased here. The salesman was actually very helpful and non pushy which is a good thing and that is why after a few weeks I came back and bought the bike. We did the standard negotiations back and forth and after the second round we struck up a deal. Reduced purchase price, serviced, and check the valve adjustments. When I picked the bike up I was assured everything checked out and the bike was 100% ready. I even spent another $400 on a helmet (I already had one from my last bike but they offered a discount so I took it). When I was doing the paperwork they pushed the used warranty for another $1000 to cover it in case of any mechanical failures..... I turned it down..... so guess what? Yep an issue a few days later.......

So after a few days (5 days later) I actually only got the chance to ride a couple times for short distances and a friend noticed I was leaking coolant in a bad way.... I immediately took it back to the dealership and asked them to check it out. I left the bike and was told they would look at it the next day around 11 am. At 4:15 pm I still had no phone call telling me what was going on .... so I called them and no answer so I left a message. 6pm and still no call back so I called again and got someone. The technician told me that the radiator cap was faulty and I needed a new one so for $25 they could order one and have it repaired in about 5-7 business days.... WHAT????? I thought they checked the bike to ensure it was in good running order..... What was checked out? Visual inspection of the parts should have shown dry rot, brakes are going, oil is black, small coolant on the inside fairing... so if this was missed what did they actually inspect? What if I was on a long ride to Tucson or something and that happened.. I would be stranded on the side of the road and maybe blown the motor..... Once again I thought they checked it as per the purchase agreement. 

I was transfered to the salesman that sold me the bike and he said he would talk to the general manager and see what he could do. I received a call back about 30 min later from the guy who said he was the general manager. Once again he gave me nothing but excuses and told me to look at it from the company's point of view..... WHAT??? His only recourse was to tell me I should have purchased the used warranty.... How about you see if from the customer's point of view..... 

Service center ....... fail...... can't call the customer back to let them know the status of their bike..

General Manager......fail....... don't give a customer a bunch of excuses and then tell the customer to see if from the business's point of view....

In the end I am out a bike for 5-7 business days and my planned trip to meet some friends in Tucson for a bike ride this weekend is blown and all I get from this dealership is a bunch of excuses and oh yeah they are paying for the $25 part..... gee thanks.... I am actually going to call ride now in Peoria and seeing if they have the part in stock and I will buy it from them and fix it myself..... 

Sad thing is that the salesman was great and I was going back this month to purchase a second bike so I have a sport bike and cruiser but not taking my business back to this company. 

Once again it's the story of a big business forgetting about the customer after the sale and no idea what customer service is. They believe that there is enough customers out there that will buy from them where repeat clientele is not a concern for them. 

I'm sure the owners don't care either and this review will probably not be seen by them or the actual real management who can make a difference. But I hope someone reads this and will take their business elsewhere. 

So they supposedly did a thorough inspection of the bike and it checked out in perfect condition... REALLY???? 

What about...... 
1- oil is old and needs to be changed
2- brakes front and back need new pads
3- rubber ring on coolant cap is dry-rotted and failed
4- excessive chain grease on swing arm and rear part of bike (chain needs to be degreased and serviced)

But I'm not a mechanic.....

I have heard rave reviews of this place so I MIGHT consider trying it again.  With a party of 12 they force you to chose from a small, boring fixed price menu ($20).  There were 2 types of omelettes and a basic eggs benedict.  You can also choise beignets or a side salad.  

For $20 I would like more of a choice than a breakfast with 2 eggs and a small salad.
Second, I asked a server there about the menu and why it was that way.  She acted all douchy and said twice ""as your hostess about that.""  Well, who the hell is the hostess?  They sent about 8 people by and no one introduced themselves.  

Service was good except for that BUT they gave themselves 20%!!! What?  First of all, I hate automatic tip taking but second, 20% is what i pay when i have good service and that should be left up to me...especially when you're charging $5 for an egg. 

I would have contacted this place directly through email but their site does not have an easily accessible email address.

PcNoyeR7lyt3KbIyIICTuA,0,2014-03-27 18:17:27,0,oQ_ZQMTi2vxHr-EHyOovdA,3,"I was a patient in this dentistry for about 3 years and I have mixed review about the place.
Good thing: Both the doctor (Dr. fuller) and the office stuffs were very nice and helpful. I don't have an insurance so the cheaper price compared to some other places helped me a lot. Being a regular patient, I had several X-rays done without a charge. The office is very clean, waiting times were moderate. 
I had few fillings, one root canal, and one wisdom tooth extraction done here and my experiences were comfortable. The extraction had some kind of complication (the tooth won't come out) so Dr. Fuller explained to me that he is going to grind the tooth inside my mouth and then take it out, so I might hear some grinding noise inside my mouth. Although I was supposed to feel scared, I somehow found it funny and to be honest didn't feel anything. 
The root canal experience too was very good. I read a lot about how sometime it can be painful but have to say I didn't feel a thing (not even the pinching of nerve that everyone talks about).
Only thing I have to say about both the procedure is that no one explained to me  what to expect AFTER the procedure was done. I wanted to ask,  but didn't feel like speaking once half of my mouth was numb. I remember I had lot of bleeding the evening after my extraction and had no idea what to do or wheather it was normal to bleed. I was not in a condition to even call and ask. I had to go online find remedies like pressing a wet tea bag etc. 

The main reason I had to change dentistry is because I was suggested two more possible  root canals 6 months after the first one. I don't think I had the best set of teeth in the world but three root canals in a year sounded little strange to me. Especially when I didn't have any sensitivity to heat and cold or a tooth ache for that matter. I decided for a second opinion and in fact went to three other dentists to confirm... they all said I only needed fillings for those two.
Anyways, for procedures like filling etc and for someone who is sure that he/she needs a root canal, I would recommend this place.",2,EQi3XCUOGH00jVsGLDtdXA

On the corner of SOM Center and Bainbridge Road, the meal I had at Harvest was unlike most suburban meals I've come to know. Warm, inviting, inspiring, unique, risky, seasonal, local and expertly prepared. If Harvest was in downtown or Tremont, foodies would be bombarding this place with their discriminating appetites on a nightly basis. Bloggers would've been waxing poetic of their every bite and food photographs would've long ago dominated a Google image search of Harvest. Yet, besides a handful of local Yelpers, word has yet to get out to the masses that Harvest-- way out in Solon-- is not only worth the drive, but certainly able to stand up to the big boys in the city. 

In trying to come up with a comparison, Harvest is everything the old Crop Bistro on West 6th used to be. A warm space with an intimate dining room boasting farm-to-table dishes. Can's of pickled veg and fruit are used as accents and reminders that the menu is inspired by seasonally fresh ingredients when possible. 

We came in January when practically nothing is in season and we found a whole lot to like. Roasted marrow bones were had as an appetizer. Meat butter and crusty bread. You certainly won't find this at the nearby Applefleas or Max and Erma's. For main course, I had the house special of the night, a plate of pork multiple ways: belly, shoulder, and bacon accommodating the seasonally fresh Brussels sprouts. Expertly seasoned and flawless in taste. I knew instantly this place was special. Other meals consumed at the table included a Polenta Cake with wild mushrooms, spicy escarole and Mackenzie Creamery truffled goat cheese. Also had was a slow cooked shortrib entree with a fingerling potato cipollini onion hash, roasted butternut squash with a balsamic roasted garlic jus. Satisfaction was the unmistakable description on each of our faces following the meal. 

Whether or not Harvest survives in an area dominated by boring sameness is to be determined. But a place like this should no longer be a secret. Travel if you must, wherever in NE Ohio you reside. There's something special going on in the kitchen of Harvest. And it needs your support to survive.",11,An8Q0oLP_2juwErLw90L8A

My wife and I decided that we wanted a change; therefore, she suggested that we pay this place a visit.

We were quite impressed with the remodeling efforts as it really opened up the lobby, and brought a more modern touch to the place. It was a Friday evening, and there was certainly a large crowd and the wait was about a 45 minutes. We didn't mind it much as we were in no hurry, and we had already committed to sampling their dishes.

She chose the rich meat sauce pasta classic, and I had the sicilian meatballs.

The pasta was superb. Not overly watery. Just right, and we didn't need to douse it in sauce to enjoy its flavor. However, the meatballs in my meal were overcooked, and lacked any of the tasty characteristics I used to remember from this place.

What really downgraded our mediocre opinion was the service. Either the place was too busy, and they didn't have enough staff, or the waitress serving us was taking long breaks in between her table rotation visits. In either case, we sat there for long periods of time with nary a refill, and it took forever for her to return once we were done with our meals. Then she brought in the signature spumoni for dessert, and it was already partially melted.

Then to top it all off, which set off my wife, is that she asked if we were together or if we wanted separate checks? Improper etiquette right there. I realize that many couples now split checks, but perhaps rephrasing the question would've been more proper. Just my opinion.

Needless to say, we will not be returning. Even though the pasta was superb, we have too many options in many parts of the valley to have to frequent this place, and have to settle for a re-peat of dreadful service.",3,a85qPvr6L63PF0v9Zs8ZAg

They just switched to a new management company and I cannot wait to leave. The gates are constantly broken now.  They used to break and would be fixed within 24 hours.  Last time, the gate by my apartment was broken for almost 3 weeks.  We are going on about 2 weeks, I think, on the front gate being broken now.  The maintenance people take forever to show up to fix anything.  Last time, it took them a week when it used to be 2 days at most.  And I recently spent the whole night in the hospital after my son had a nail go through his shoe and his foot on the property. This, after a nail went through my niece's shoe, luckily it went sideways and missed her foot.  When I went  into the office to let them know, they tried keeping the nail after I mentioned them having a possible lawsuit if it happened to us again or even someone else.  Then, I was told they would have me do an incident report which consisted of them taking down my name and apartment number.  No apologies, no compassion, NOTHING!!!!!!   They mentioned having maintenance come over and look through the rocks by my door, but of course, no one came.  I even told them they could come to my door and I would show them exactly where it went into my son's foot!!!!

Chocolate chip pancakes ($5): Awful. The pancakes came in a stack of three and looked good, but failed on the tasting good part. The chocolate chips were disturbingly crunchy and tasted off. Is it too much to ask for melty gooey chocolate chips? I took about 4 measly bites and couldn't stomach anymore. The waitress asked if I wanted it to-go. Um, no, because these pancakes taste like ass. 1/5

I have been going to this Walgreens for nearly a year and had positive experiences with the pharmacy, regardless of the consistently slow service. However, in the last two months, the customer service has completely diminished. Last month, I had an issue with a prescription discount card and the girl who helped me ended up working it out. This month, I refilled the same prescription and when I went to refill it, they claimed my discount card wouldn't go through. I ended up waiting there for an hour while the same girl who helped me last time tried to figure it out. 

After an hour wait and attitude from her the entire time, the girl finally found a solution and I was able to get the discount. However, while ringing me up, she informed me what she did regarding the discount last time in order for it to work out and told me that I need to remember this moving forward and if I had remembered it, it wouldn't have taken so long. I wasn't aware that the customer is responsible for remembering what the Walgreen's pharmacy staff does on their own commuters to make a prescription and discount card go through. I then asked if Walgreens has an area where they can write notes about perscriptions so they can remember certain issues and if they can make an admin note on their end to avoid these problems. The girl rudely informed me how many customers she has and how it's impossible to remember everyone's notes and Walgreen's does not have a way to right notes in a patient's file. After she got heated with me and I was leaving, she rudely said, ""you have a Merry Christmas"" in a way that meant the opposite. So after waiting for my prescription for an hour after coming back three days in a row to get it and then being treated like this, I think I will consider visiting another Walgreen's location for my pharmacy needs.",3,RBZ_kMjowV0t6_nv2UKaDQ

Check in was easy but crowded. There could have been more staff checking in patrons that holiday weekend. They have complimentary water in self service dispensers near by so that was appreciated (NOTE: a few times the water dispensers were empty and not refilled). 

They have designated elevators for three section of floors (it 1-12, 13-x, etc). Makes for quicker access to your floor.

Our room was clean with two queen beds. The room had a nice view of Luxor and the airport (if a view of airport can be even 'nice'). The beds were comfortable but we felt the pillows were too plush and too high. The bathroom had a shower, a tub, two sinks, and a toilet with a separate door. It had basic toiletries (conditioner, shampoo, soap, lotion).

The two closet space was nice. 

Huge con: NO COMPLIMENTARY COFFEE at all. No coffee grinds. Sad. 

The show ticketing area was nice and made it easy to book Cirque shows. Be aware there's like a $15 convenience PER TICKET even if you book a cirque show that's inside their own hotel.

Self parking is $10/day but has in and out privileges. You can also park at any MGM hotel with that $10/day fee (just use your room key). 

We ate at Lupo and Citizens at the hotel. Lupo was alright (birthday dinner) but Citizen's breakfast was spectacular.

You can find your final hotel bill using the guide feature on your TV. Made for easy reconciliation and dividing of costs among friends. 

Overall a nice stay.",10,pQ6jXAENt9gUHqQvXl4DTg

Not only was my ""crispy shrimp"" rock-hard, it arrived mixed in with my hubby's tacos/smashed together on a single dish, much too small for 5 tacos! The ""goat cheese"" in my 2nd choice, tasted like sour cream and there was nothing candied about the pepitas in that mushroom taco! My hubby's fish tacos arrived with one fried to oblivion and the other indistinguishable! The real/only draw is the decor--it's a very sensational spread!

They put everyone on the right side of the restaurant, and it was full.  Got the feeling they were   short on staff.  The hot food line around the corner from the ice cream/minnie mouse was actually closed, which was a surprise to me.  Typically dinners have more selections, so more $ and It seemed the opposite.  They did have prime rib, and I wanted to try a piece to see how it compares to Mandarin.   To be fair, there were only couple little bites that were chewable, as I got the end piece, so hard to comment.   

The stir fry station is the main thing I like coming here and it was good as usual.  The soft ice cream is a plus as well!   I don't usually like fruits at buffets, but the watermelon was very nice. Peach and mandarin orange are good choices to have too.  I don't really bother with the live cooking section, as I have had it in the past and found the meat hard to chew.  Looking at the table beside us, it seemed still is.  You can't expect an all you can eat place to offer the best meats.   But I might try some mussels next time.

Overall, it was still a good experience and value. But, I was a bit disappointed in what seemed like less food choices.  Stir fry # 1 reason, and #2 is the more choices they offer compared to other similar buffets I prefer this place.   We will be coming back next week for sons birthday party, so hope they do not close down the 1 food section as they did for dinner.",1,MFFTDftUkNBIZQVhdrM5wg

That said, it's an ultra-lounge. VIP seating available, dance floor, live DJ and signature drinks. You don't have to worry about people bumping into you on the dance floor like you will on the hottest night clubs. 
The decor is mediocre. The light show is average, but there are some extinguisher blast effects and they hand out party favors (light tubes, bandannas, sunglasses) from time to time, not to mention the infamous cheeseburger cart (with free grub).
It's a casual, social, party like atmosphere. I get the feeling I'm with 150 of my closest friends more than a Vegas hot spot.
We attended free with our hotel key, but I can't imagine them denying you access if you asked really nicely at the front desk.

GBDC - Ghostbar Dayclub - attended Nov 1 2014 for Day of the Killer Costumes and Jan. 24 2015 for Toga Party.
Nov. 1 - The most insane, awesome, fun costume party I've ever been to! 5-stars for this one! Super-packed with tasteful competitive costumes and a friendly environment. DJ and MC were on point. Very well done! Cheeseburger cart - check.

Jan. 24 - My gf and I were 2 of 5 patrons that actually dressed in togas! AVN star, Farrah Abraham was the guest, but she didn't even dress in a toga. If the employees hadn't dressed, it would've been really dumb, but they all dressed out. 
There were gogo dancers and the SWAG guy making sure everyone was having a great time. Cheeseburger cart made another appearance. We had a great time, but wished more patrons had participated. Are we the only ones that know how to party right? 
Not nearly as crowded as the Nov. 1 event and then, it hit me. Unless they're offering cash prizes, the participation goes WAY down. Most ppl want something for nothing. We just want to have a great time!",1,bdIK2pTQROMye2kOgfQF1g

We came in, and things were just fine. We were seated quickly, and the waitress was great. We went up, filled our bowls, and then waited for the cooks to take the bowls, which is when it started to go downhill. At other Mongolian grills I've been to (Flat Top Grills and several other companies), the cooks are always really personable, fun, and interactive. Here, the lone cook didn't even make eye contact except to say ""Just leave it."" He wasn't even busy at that moment -- it was just The Fiancee and me standing there, and nothing was on the grill.

The food came quickly, once he put it on the grill, but it was disappointing. Now, obviously, I created my own meal; however, something happened between what I put in my bowls and what was delivered to my table. That is to say, I'm something of a sauce-fiend, so, whereas FTG's instructions say 3-4 scoops of sauce, I mix at least 10 scoops from a variety of the sauce choices. Understandably, then, I was incredulous to discover that my meal was DRY and nearly flavorless, as though they hadn't put any of the sauce concoction I'd created onto my meats, veggies, and noodles. I don't know where all that saucy goodness went, but it wasn't onto my food ... It turns out that The Fiancee had the same issue with hers (she had done 4 scoops of sauce) -- it was dry and not very flavorful. 

For my 2nd serving (yes, I went back up for more -- I was still hungry!), I tried to avoid the dryness by using fewer noodles and veggies but keeping the sauce portion the same. I also switched from the rice noodles to the ""Chinese Yellow Noodles."" Well, the meal was slightly saucier and tastier, though not much, but the yellow noodles were just simply awful. Soggy, creamy, mushy, ICK. I just got grossed out thinking about them again!

Needless to say, The Fiancee and I were not happy with our FTG experience this time around. I'm sure we'll try once more (we all, even restaurants, have bad nights), but right now, I have lost my appetite for the Flat Top Grill.",2,cDhs0eRMGtVVXzr5eiGiIQ

Great.  Since I wanted a crepe, they pointed in the opposite direction. So I jumped into yet another line and because of the layout, I wasn't sure if I was in the right place again (didn't see any crepes being made) so I ventured around the corner, saw crepe making and a register and stood there. And stood there, all the while being absolutely ignored. Finally, I asked if this is where I order and the unfriendly girl making crepes pointed to the line in which I previously stood. Kind of stupid since the menu can't be seen from the line so how would someone know what to order?? Based on a recommendation, I already knew what I wanted but had I not, that would have been frustrating. Seating can suck as well.

Well, my modem was just fine, which your tech confirmed, and he leaves with the new modem. However, I'm still getting charged a modem lease anyway. 

After having 5 days of service, you guys choose to bill me but I'm not aware of it because I was told I would see a bill in 30 days.

The present day, cookie-cutter Taco Mac is just pathetic.

Addendum:  As you can see, my review was responded to by one of their staff.  Well, I think it is all an empty gesture.  Avoid the Taco Mac of today.  It is NOTHING like the ones that used to be scattered around Atlanta in the 1980's.  As for the response from Taco Mac, I see lots of them from the staff of Taco Mac on various reviews.  So, here's some food for thought:

1 -  Our second visit was because of a poor, disgusting visit the first time.  It was VERY apparent NOTHING had changed between the two visits.  Why would I accept a second comp visit only to rack up a THIRD horrible experience?  Fool me once, shame on me.  Fool me twice, shame on you.  Fool me a third time, I am just a f*****g idiot for going back again.

2 -  Instead of posting, ""gee, we are sorry"" comments, HOW ABOUT FIXING THE PROBLEMS YOUR CHARLOTTE LOCATIONS SEEM TO HAVE?????  The Huntersville location has already closed.

We did that and it went well and I got some going home instructions that said to bring him in in two weeks and that visit was covered under the original charge. Two weeks pass I take him for his follow up.

I should have stayed on the strip and dealt with traffic and distance. The entire building wreaked of smoke inside. Poor ventilation. Room was ok but it still had that slight stale smoke smell. I felt like I carried it with me in public. That was embarrassing. 

The valet/door men were incredibly rude. Like jaw dropping. Specifically a blonde male with an accent that worked evenings. My husband and I are from a magical land where Uber's can pick you up anywhere... not just one location. So we were going to a formal dinner on the strip and were waiting to be picked up along the roadway. This blonde valet walks over to us. Instead of asking us if we needed a cab or help, he demanded to know why we were standing there. We said we were waiting for our ride. He started yelling (not telling us, yelling and pointing in another direction) that share ride cannot pick up there, it's illegal. He did not offer us directions to the ""correct place"" or treat us with any courtesy. 

Again, as guests of the hotel, as guests spending several hundred a night on a lux suite, and as guests dropping money in the casino, this guy could kinda chill out and maybe just smile and try to be helpful. Because even if none of that was happening, how about just not being a jagoff and trying to help people out?

There are also bums. Everywhere.  All over Fremont St. Day and night. And they are very aggressive. It got to the point I got tired of going out. And I'm from Chicago.  

Stay on the strip. Your eyes, lungs, and clothes will thank you. And you'll be treated better and have an overall better experience.",5,6TizFaEyIxDKNDNSzbuIaA

I wasn't expecting much- Mexican food in my area is pretty whitewashed, but this was actually the real deal. It's fancier than your average taco stand, and their fare is a bit more upscale than street food, but the fact that they actually pay attention to what they're doing REALLY shows.

For an appetizer we got fried shrimp, and they were incredible! Butterflied, battered, and fried just perfectly. I ordered the chicken mole, my girlfriend got the steak and shrimp, and the ladies split some enchiladas. Everything was excellent, and extremely comparable to good upscale dining in Mexico. 

(I should note- my girl made some enchiladas today and they blew Zocalo's out the water, but sometimes you just want to let someone else do the work...)

We went to Giada's for my wife's 49th Birthday while in Vegas.  My wife and I were both looking forward to having dinner here and were not surprised by the high prices.  We expected it, since we were eating at a place owned by a famous Chef'. 

The restaurant was elegant with a pretty decent view of the strip,  However, we were very surprised by the poor quality of our dinner.  Seriously Disappointed!! .  

Our filets and lobster ravioli was seriously short of our expectations.  While we expected the small sized portion, which is typical with finer dining (you know, less is more), the flavor did not not make up for it.  Both of our filets were burned on one side and was topped by one small ravioli.  Yes, that's correct, one ravioli.  The ravioli was very dry and hard around the edges, where I had to use my knife to cut it.  You would think at $56 dollars (ala carte) you would expect it to be perfect!  I just could figure...The only way to ruin a filet is by over cooking it....They did.

Service was okay, I say just okay because our waitress was having trouble with the other wait staff. A little disagreement over using each others menus.  The service staff need a lot more training it seems.  Our small table for two quickly became over crowded. as the dish (extra dish) piled up,  With the raised place mat, bread dish, and glasses, there was little room for anything else.  Hence, once the bread tray arrived, it didn't easily fit on the table.  So picture what it looked like when the bus boy didn't remove empty dishes,  I was forced to start stacking dishes on my table and had to ask to have them removed.  .

They did bring my wife a very tiny dessert and sparkling wine because it was her birthday.  However, I think it was more that we complained to the manager, who told us we should have told him or the waitress sooner.  

The interesting thing was that the bill included an Iphone to take a survey on the service we received.  One of the questions was ""Did the manager visit you during your meal?"" Since he didn't show up until after we had received our bill and completed the survey, I said ""no.""   Funny, after I advised him of the poor quality of food, the manager asked if I had already completed the survey.  The irony was he never offered any way to make up for our poor experience.  My opinion, it was because I had already filled out the survey.

So, after settling our $200 bill,  we agreed we wouldn't be returning to Giada's on our next trip to Vegas.  Especially since Vegas has plenty of great restaurants to choose from during our four to six visits a year.",0,DoE5j2k9gIWH_UXPFTM4Ww

I ate here on my previous trip to Vegas in 2006 and the food was decent, but this time, the breakfast buffet was pretty bad. The eggs literally had water sitting in the bottom of the pan and were beyond mushy and some of the other food just didn't look appetizing. We ate here 2 mornings and one morning we got this humongous glass of OJ and the other morning we got a glass of OJ that was meant for a baby...pretty weird and trying to get our servers attention on the 2nd visit for refills was pretty impossible. The highlight of the buffet was the omelette station. You can pretty much customize what you want in it, and is made to order; the wait was only around 5 minutes for one. Honestly, the only reason we ate here 2 mornings was because we had coupons from staying at PH and it was cheaper than the cafe in the hotel.

The Venetian management recently took over this place and let me just say that it made the world of difference. I worked with Maria Mariano in Events and if you EVER need to request or work with someone ask for her. The event we hosted was partially outdoors, the Jay Z suite and the indoor bar and it went off without a hitch. The outdoor area is really pretty and there's a lot going on (tv,music,pac man game, and pool) to keep guests at a corporate function entertained. 

The only minuses I would say is that I spent a boatload of money for a couple of hours and was not given any perks (a room stay or slot money) like the majority of venues had offered me. I was bummed about that and in the future if there was an equally attractive place with just as good as staff, but the other place offered some token for doing business with them, I would unf. choose the other place.

It's nice to have a suite and have housekeeping service 2x a day, but it kind of misses in execution.  You only get 2 sets of towels which gives you limited flexibility if you need more, the provided accompaniments in the bathroom are not high quality and miss some of the nicer ones you would want, and they don't give you enough hangers.  All of this is fixable with a phone call so it's not tragic, but just makes the Venetian fall a little short of a true 5 star experience.  

One Note of Caution:  My date and I are not really sensitive, but the standard sheets on the bed made us both itch terribly.  We suffered for 2 nights and then called and told the desk.  We were afraid they were bed bugs.  They brought us some hypo-allergenic sheets and said they have to do that alot and we didn't have any more problem, and those sheets were just as comfortable as the standard sheets.  I don't know why they don't just make them standard.

Checkout was a nightmare.  Even though the line was small, it took forever.  I can only imagine what it would be like at peak time.  Checkin was a breeze although you will have to deal with a lot of upselling pressure to upgrade your room which isn't very attractive to me.",0,gWs7Oeer3zL3wvbehkbQEg

A couple of weeks ago, I took my main Dyson to this store for cleaning.  I hadn't had it back there during that 2  1/2 years. I have three dogs, and vacuum constantly.  I took it there because I have a carpet remnant in the back of my SUV. I vacuumed after one of the dogs spilled their water bowl on the rug, and it was damp when I vacuumed. I didn't know it at the time. Water accumulated in the canister. After that, I figured that it was time to get it professionally cleaned out - something that I had not done in those 2  1/2 years.  

Well, the guy that took my vacuum was a little too sassy for me. He complained about the Dysons, and how I needed another brand. They have Simplicity and Sebo which are both in the $800 range. I wasn't interested, so he wasn't interested.  He gave me the ticket, and I left. 

Later, he called me to tell me that the vacuum had ""dog p*ss"" (dog urine) and that it would cost me much more to have it cleaned.  He was very angry on the phone, and I had to correct his language. By the time they added everything up, they wanted over $200. I ended up paying $140 just for the cleaning and filters.  

After I got the vacuum back, I went to another (non-related) vacuum store. Vegas Vac did not put the filters in correctly, they did not let the vacuum dry out, the vacuum did need a new roller, but it also needed a new belt. They did not notice the belt.  When I got the vacuum from Vegas Vac, a different guy was there.  He did not seem interested and did not offer to help me out with the vacuum.  He just watched me stumble out of the store with it.  I don't know if they changed management or ownership, but the service has gotten worse. I guess that if you want to spend $1000 on a vacuum, you are in luck.  Otherwise, go somewhere else.",5,mdGmDYRJRB8dsTfoTjNfjA

First of all, there was no one up front manning the counter so we had to wait...and wait...and wait for someone to come seat us. The restaurant was not busy but for some reason waiting seemed to be the theme of the day. When we were finally seated, we ordered drinks which took an excessively long period of time to get. Then we had to wait some more for our server took our order. She only came over after I went over to another server to ask for some help. Had I not been with my Dad, I would have left. He seemed OK with the waiting but it was 40 minutes before our order was taken...and again, it was NOT busy.  That's just unacceptable.

The service could be faster but there was only one waitress and one hostess/waiter? It was my fault for saying we wanted all the food at the same time. I feel like if the dishes came out as they were prepared, we wouldn't have had to wait ~20 minutes for the food. 

I liked the atmosphere of the restaurant. It had the bar area like Jack Astor's and the booths like Milestones with dim lighting. If you're a sports fan, they position the TV's all around the place so no matter where you're sitting, you can watch the action.

The menu was standard American food (with some Mexican dishes) with similar pricing compared to competitors. We ordered the following items:

8oz. Top Sirloin - $25.49 - Ordered medium rare and it was cooked between rare to medium rare. I was satisfied with the quality of the meat. It could be more tender but you can't expect too much at this price point. The portion of the baked potato it came with was very generous. More generous than any other restaurant I've been to. Same goes for the side of vegetables.

Blackened Basa - $22.99 - Generous layer of guac on top. Dish was flavourable and wasn't overly salty. The only thing I would say to improve the dish is to cut down the level of blackening (is this a verb?). It dries the fish out a lot.

Baked Onion Soup - $8.49 - Liked the flavour of the soup, not overly salty or strong in onion flavour, did not like the thickish layer of cheese on top of it. 

Basa Fish Tacos $16.49 w/ quinoa and arugula salad + $1.99 - I feel like if they used another type of fish, it would taste better. I wasn't a fan of the chipotle honey dressing but I'm biased towards not liking spicy food. I wouldn't order this dish again because the two other mains tasted much better. The salad, on the other hand, was delicious. I liked the dressing it came with.

10 pc. Fryers (Wings) with Signature NY Butter Sauce - $13.99 -The only reason why I ordered this dish was because I was curious as to what this sauce would taste like. It ended up tasting like it was only coated with butter. I was fine with it but I know a lot of people wouldn't be. I find this dish to be not worth the price because the size of the wings were so small. Plus they only give 2 pieces of carrots and celery for one order.

The total came about to $122 incl. tips and taxes for 3 people. Is that too pricey? You be the judge. I would come back again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to persuade people to eat here.",0,VTuTxNnmxcbnPsLh_j4JFQ

I asked, can't you remove the yolk? They said ""no"" and ""we are very busy"", and the waitress said I can speak wth the manager. At this point the neighboring customers and few workers were listening in and watching, I felt uncomfortable and left. Couldn't but wonder, is this everywhere in AZ? We have no problems in California.

I wanted to see and called a nearby restaurant (4 minutes away from this place) and the manager said they serve egg whites, and removing the yolk was easy and possible to do. Why couldn't the Henhouse do the same? Do they serve egg beaters or some other egg alternative, hindering them to do so? I wouldn't know cause I only got ""no"" and ""we can't"" and ""we are busy"" and the final ""you can speak to our manager"".

My advice to the restaurant: Please post on your menu - WE DO NOT SERVE EGG WHITES - To avoid costumers feeling put in the spot. Please don't make them feel like they have to explain why they can't eat something, certainly in front of other costumers.

Lunch was such a success that we came back for a quick dinner before leaving the hotel for the night. This time I ordered the Carnitas Taco, and it was flawless. The pork was juicy and flavorful, and the pineapple chunks provided some much-appreciated sweetness. 

The only miss of the entire day was the creme brûlée, which was topped with bananas, something I'd never seen.

We got a bunch of different appetizers and quite a few entrees as well. I remember the food being good for the most part. The alligator was tender and juicy and the crawfish spinach artichoke dip was so so good. The Tomohawk steak was so amazing and came on a giant bone they let you take home for your dog if you want. The only complaint the first time was the Beignets I ordered for dessert. Im from New Orleans and Beignets are supposed to be fluffy and sweet and a bit crispy and covered with powdered sugar or honey. These were disgusting and hard and falling apart and tasted like gross old overused oil. They were barely dusted with powdered sugar and such a dissapointment. 

The second time I went was Oct 2014 with my boyfriend. I bought a groupon so I thought that would be worth it since their prices are a little bit on the higher side. We had a few of their specialty drinks which were good and had a great amount of alcohol. Then we ordered Gumbo and the Ahi tuna tartare (?) for appetizers. The gumbo was below average. It didnt have very good flavor and wasnt even very warm. The tuna was even worse. It was cut kind of sloppy and jsut drenched in whatever sauce they use on it. For entrees my boyfriend got Jambalaya and I got a catfish and shrimp dish. The Jambalaya was also under-seasoned with a small amount of shrimp which was added for an additional charge.

My first impression of this restaurant was terrific! It is located on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan hotel. If you go up the escalators, make an immediate left. It is located between two restaurants, STK and Blue Ribbon. The decor of the place is beautiful and formal, fits the Mediterranean theme. I would have loved to sit outdoor but didn't want to sweat in the Vegas heat. The outdoor seating overlooks the strip.. it would be great to dine outside for dinner! The only thing that ""threw"" the place off was the seafood laying out at the right of the restaurant. But little did I know that you walk over there to pick the fish you want in your stomach, which is pretty neat.

My friends and I quickly got our drinks as well as their complimentary bread with olive oil. Supposedly, the bread is toasted over an open flame! We had two waiters, who were fantastic. We couldn't decide what to get for the appetizers, so one of the waiters recommended 3 to us to share.

Food we ordered:
-Appetizers:
Tomato Salad (Feta cheese, seasoned with Greek herbs & extra virgin olive oil)
Hortopita (Organic Greens & Herbs)
Greek Meze Plate (Tarama, Htipiti, and Tzatziki)
-Entrees:
Shetland Island Organic Salmon (With steamed vegetables)
Shrimp Saganaki (Cous cous, tomato and feta)
Colorado Prime Lamb Chops (French fries & broccoli) - $10 extra
-Desserts:
Greek Yogurt
Karidopita (With kaimaki ice cream)

Tomato Salad (4/5): I highly recommend this if you do like your tomatoes ripe, juicy, and red. I'm not a cheese person, but one of my friends kept bringing up about how delicious the feta cheese was. I would compare this salad to Olive Garden's... not comparable to the taste but the craving of wanting more after your plate is clean. If only this salad was refillable like Olive Garden's. This was probably my favorite out of the 3 appetizers.

Hortopita (3/5): If I can explain this in two words, it'd be Spinach Pie. It's a flaky pastry served with herbs inside. This appetizer was my least favorite. 

Greek Meze Plate (4/5): The 3 spreads on here were freshly made. This appetizer is personal preference on what spreads fit your palate. I ranked them #1 Htipiti, #2 Tarama, and #3 Tzatziki. It was my first time trying Htipiti (roasted red pepper and feta cheese) and Tarama (fish roe, olive oil, and lemon). I found the Tzatsiki less creamier here than the others I tried in other Mediterranean restaurants.

Shrimp Saganaki (3/5): Presentation was okay. I expected it to be different. This dish is served with 4 pieces of shrimp and cous cous. Nothing memorable with the shrimp. The tomato sauce was delicious! I would usually mix the tomato sauce and cous cous. I wouldn't order this again.

Shetland Island Organic Salmon: My friend ordered this. The salmon is huge, not sure if it was lunch-sized! It was cooked perfectly... probably one of the best I've tried. Besides the salmon, you get trunks of broccoli on your plate. 

Colorado Prime Lamb Chop: My friend ordered this. Two lamb chops served with a bed of fries. I only tried a bite of the lamb chop, but my friend devoured this plate. Even though this plate comes with fries, I would alter them for something different if I was to order this.

Greek Yogurt (4/5): I actually ended up liking this! Greek yogurt with raspberry sauce presented in a martini glass. If you are not sure about what greek yogurt tastes like, then think of tart flavor at your local frozen yogurt place! Very simple.

Karidopita: I actually ordered this with another friend, but the waiter messed it up. Anyways, the walnut cake had a certain taste to it while the ice cream brought the sweet flavor to balance everything out. Moist and flavorful.

My friends and I left satisfied and happy. Once again, our waiters were great! Our waters never went below halfway, I believe. They were prompt and always around if we needed them. Their lunch is definitely something you should try out!",1,-dalNrShfTcwbNlYklsolg

So we gave them our table and went to a smaller one. My husband asked for something to clean off the table and they handed him a rag. When a customer asks for something to clean their table what should happen is that you should be a little embarrassed you have dirty tables and then go clean the tables-NOT hand a customer a rag. 
It took almost 30 minutes to get our pizza. It was just us and the big group and we ordered way before them. When they finally brought our pizza it was in a box. I took that as a hint to leave but we didn't. The pizza looked really good but the crust was very dense. We didn't care for it.

I would classify this in the ""pizza parlor"" sense, which is classy, nice ambiance, not too greasy, and has the right amount of Italian feel, as opposed to a ""pizza chain,"" which is so greasy that you could douse an empty cardboard box of said pizza from craptastic pizza chain in water and discern no difference from before. Bad pizza joints also have a limited menu, with few salads and *shudder* bad breadsticks (which is, of course, a mortal sin). Roman Candle fulfilled all of the ""pizza parlor"" requirements, with really good oregano breadsticks, amazing salad, especially for the price of said salad, at something like four dollars for a well-sized bowl of leaves with creamy dressing, and of course, a huge selection of pizza. They give you a choice of sauce, and have almost fifteen toppings (not that anyone's counting or anything). Also, they have wine, which I found a little surprising. A good surprising, but a surprising nonetheless. I mean, it is a pizza place after all. 
There is a bottom floor with a playpen for the little kids, so that was mostly a family zone. The service was really good, our server came and checked on us about three-quarters through our meal, which was a little late, but it was extremely busy on a Friday night, so I don't blame her. She was really courteous, asking if anyone needed any refills, take-out boxes, things like that. 
The best thing about Roman Candle? The pizza of course, but I love the ambiance, really cozy even though it's a very open place.

Having moved here from the DC area + spending a lot of time in NYC, there are a lot of B-Rs there & I got used to them.  The PGH area has virtually none & went here often the first year after I moved to the North Hills area.  

As noted, the ice cream is fine & they have all the fixings for any ice cream treat that can be imagined.  What I dis-liked about the place is how the owner operates the business.  First, there's a sign that reads, essentially, Credit Cards Not Accepted, but they do take them, except for very small purchases.  When I first went there, I had a B-R coupon that was not expired & not restricted to any geographic location.  They wouldn't take the coupon, saying ""it says it's only good at participating locations & we don't participate"".  Then there's their own software that automatically prints two offers at the bottom of each receipt.  Staff are first instructed to ask if a receipt is wanted & if it is, they tear it from the register in such a manner that only one of the offers appears ($1 off for completing a survey).  Their prices were also on the high side from what I was used to.

The shop itself could use some updating as it's on one end of a 3rd rate strip shopping center.  Maneuvering a car is also a bit of a challenge in limited space not very far off busy Freeport Road.  I finally quit going as there are plenty of other less-expensive expensive & as-good options.
Honoring coupons is generally a way to build & maintain customer loyalty, but the owner of this B-R franchise thinks otherwise. Since he survived long before I showed-up, no doubt he'll survive just fine without me.",0,lIvtLm2lAoz1N2zTlDdMag

I'm not really sure about my entire bowl, but the sauces that I paired them with made the whole bowl way way better. I included a pic of the 2 sauces I liked the most with my bowl; it really tones the flavor down and makes it combine nicely :)

But we had four orders of food, and you tack that on without a mention? You bet we had a talk with the supervisor about it to remove that. The supervisor was very rude about it after.

Secondly, the steak and eggs that my boyfriend got was gross. The steak is comparable to golden corral and legit tastes like ass once swallowed. My boyfriend also threw up after eating it. 

Third, oxtail soup was good but not so amazing to bring me back here. We went to Orleans the next day as they now served oxtail soup late night as well. The broth at Orleans was much better.

To get here, you can jump on a shuttle at the airport or long term parking, in order to rent a car. The shuttle is about every 15 minutes. If you are not an Emerald member, you will need to check-in at the National Car Rental counter, in order to get your car. If you're an Emerald member, you simply follow the signage to the garage. Pick any car located in the Emerald Aisle. I prefer 4-door sedans with enclosed trunks, since I want to keep my luggage hidden, until I can check into my hotel. SUVs are nice, but there's no cover to hide your stuff you store in the back. National Car Rental usually has nice, new cars available. Every car that I've rented, in the last 3 years, has been new. Some still had all their fresh-off-the-fleet pastic covers on them. No complaints here!

When you pick your ride (typically an intermediate sized car), be sure to do the following:
-Adjust your rear and side view mirrors.
-Verify the amount of gas in your tank. If it's not full, be sure to let the person at the exit gate know.
-Check for any damage around the car.
-Make sure that the hood of your car is closed properly!

Seriously, check the hood of your car is closed properly. I've had 2 instances when they haven't been properly shut. Both times, I didn't notice it until I had left the lot. Pulling over to the side of a road to do so would be a problem. 

When you leave the lot, you stop by the check-out booth. As an Emerald member, simply providing your drivers license. They'll scan the car and match your name to your reservation and then you're off. I've never had an issue with any of the cars breaking down.  

Return is easy for everyone. Return to the rental car lot. Pull into one of many lanes at the National Car Rental floor in the garage. An attendant will scan your car. Get your receipt and you'red done!",3,mwpqciBkHxE2MBw4bjKqpA

When we ordered our shakes we pointed to the picture depicted on the menu of a shake with banana, chocolate, and peanut butter. Rather than explaining that the picture was a special order shake that would be an additional 4$ on top of the already inflated price of the shake. It seems to me this fee would be clarified on the front end by our waitress. This was not a busy restaurant scenario. There was ample staff in correlation to customers. We came during a slow time.

However, we aren't in California anymore, and North Carolina isn't exactly known for its Vietnamese cuisine.  Lang Van, however, is easily on par with the best Vietnamese food I've had anywhere.

We had the temple rolls (fried tofu spring rolls) which came with a savory peanut sauce.  I've had many peanut sauces that were sweet and peanuttier, but this one had more soy sauce in it, and maybe some wine.  We ate every drop of it.  The rolls themselves were also excellent.  The tofu was perfect, and they were also filled with vermicelli, bean sprouts, and mint.  

I had the fresh rice noodles (#72, I think).  This reminded me somewhat of Thai drunken noodles: wide, flat noodles, stir-fried with veggies and fried tofu in garlic sauce.  Mine came with broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, snow peas, bean sprouts, and onions.  My husband had the special fried rice, and it was no problem for him to get it without shrimp.  While we both loved our meals, the menu is so big that I'll be tempted to try something else next time.

Instead of the usual fortune cookie, here you get what I like to think of as a mini dessert buffet: peanut cookies, fortune cookies, little tamarind candies.

The rainbow trout melted in your mouth, and the duck confit was good as well. Flavours were not too subtle, but not too rich either; just right. Everyone was really happy with their apps and mains.

I will say that if I had to pay regular price, I wouldn't be so impressed with their desserts or drinks. I ordered a mimosa ($8) and someone ordered soft mojito ($11). They were both not very good, and the portion was really small (mimosa came in a very skinny glass, and was portioned for like, 4 small gulps), so a double whammy on both drinks. 

The desserts were also very simple; not like ""awesome because it was so simple and amazing"", but like, ""just simple and meh"". Like I said, I think this place has good appetizer and great mains, but not so much for dessert and specialty drinks.

I called to see what are the availabilities and upon hearing that there is one available in half an hour, I quickly grabbed my keys and drove to Town Square.  The Birthday Suit is located on the second floor of LOOK Society.  

I had to fill out a short form and was waited upon by Katia.  The front was clean and chic, with super cool and clever art.  Katia was awesome.  She is definitely a professional and made me feel at ease with the Brazilian wax process.  Also personable, detailed, again, nothing but positive adjectives to describe her.

On top of the painless process, this only cost me $20 since I am a first time Brazilian wax client here.  

I will be coming back again and again since the mere $35 for a Brazilian wax is a steal, along with the chic modern office, and the wonderful staff here at The Birthday Suit.

Pros:

* very spacious
* many large, comfy leather couches (so many, in fact, that there was at least one couch available for each person waiting for surgery - no sharing with strangers!)
* low table in front of each couch
* wifi available and signs explaining how to access said wifi
* pretty, calming animal and nature shows playing on the flat screens rather than annoying CP24 - and no tv sound!
* solid music choices - not musak, not elevator jazz, a good background combo of quiet pop, folk, and classics
* free coffee, fruit, and cookie/muffin snacks 

Cons: 

* located in Mississauga (which, from my downtown, bike-riding perspective, might as well be on the moon)
* the whole room is brightly lit, with no dim area for those recovering from surgery

NGA2-FhrAbG8umRaw0Z-Lw,1,2015-04-08 23:55:20,1,Apl7pZsd1bnehqsa9GWR_A,5,"I did a good bit of research prior to chosing Total Spine for my back issues. I didn't request a specific doctor , however I was scheduled with Dr. Giedraitis. The staff was very friendly and got me in the same week. I did read reviews on a variety of review sites out of curiosity as my back ground is in Medical/ Cosmetic Practice Consulting. There weren't many but what I could find mostly focused on negative bedside manner. This didn't phase me because having worked and consulted with hundreds of physicians my personal opinion on bedside manner doesn't sway my decision on choosing a doctor. I mostly care that the doctor listens, explains and sets up a plan to address my problems and doesn't make me feel unimportant. Bottom line. If they can do that in 10 minutes or if it takes 30 minutes I don't care. He did exactly what I needed without all the fluff and basically straight to the point. That's what I care about. His bedside manner was never an issue and I personally feel patients put too much emphasis on this overall. Are you inviting your doctor to Thanksgiving dinner or do you want your issues addressed?  Doctors are people too and have a tremendous responsibility and schedule. No one has perfect days and Doctors minds work a lot different than others. They are scientists as well as a businessman/woman. They have families and responsibilities like we all do. Do your part as the patient so doctors can do theirs to best care for you. They have multiple patients, multiple procedures, meetings, documentation,  protocol to follow that constantly is being changed by the government and FDA. Tests to order, tests to read, patients to refer, doctors to correspond with, partners to work with and employees to rely on for a smooth daily process and not to mention Insurance companies who want to only pay pennies on the dollar and then they write off thousands of dollars for work done that they won't get paid for. It's not the glamorous high life. Long story short.... if your doctor seems rushed there's a reason... if you have questions they can't read your mind, if you want warm and fuzzy get a kitten. If you want a good , qualified doctor get referrals,  research and check their history. 

Personally, I think Dr. G has a fine bedside manner. I feel he is focused on the best approach for his patients and he explained my condition and options in detail and he did listen to my concerns and addressed them accordingly. Everything was seamless and I have had my appointments, tests, follow ups and procedures schedule all within days of each other. 

Dr. G actually compared a past xray I had and read the report and found that the radiologist missed something and he took new x-rays to compare and showed me what was missed and set me up for an MRI with specific instructions to the technician to focus on the area in question and get a better look into the area that was overlooked. This to me is far more important than the warm and fuzzies.

I appreciate their flexibility and getting me schedule in a timely manner and I'm extremely grateful that there is a plan in place to address my extreme back pain and I'm looking forward to regaining a better quality of life with the professional guidance of Dr.G.

This company is on contract with my apartment complex, and we are infested with bed bugs and other pests. My unit has had bed bugs since July. (It also has chronic cockroach and termite problems, but that is more the landlord's problem.) In July, I notified the landlord that I needed pest control. A US Pest technician came out, spritzed a small amount of liquid chemical around, and found various problems that were my responsibility to fix. So far, so good.

As time wore on, my infestation became worse and worse, and for some reason, the technician did not return for the required second and third treatments. I left for a month and nothing had obviously happened while I was gone: the bed bugs were a whole lot worse on September 12 when I returned.

I notified the manager again and soon the US Pests came to spray. This time the guy spritzed even less chemical and found more ways to blame me for a potential reinfestation. Meanwhile I have been doing EVERYTHING possible to reduce the problem on my own. I spent my own money on various solutions and put blood, sweat and tears into laundry and vacuuming constantly. I threw out my bed frame because the bugs were inside the hollow tubing, and these technicians had done nothing to detect or eliminate these persistent infestations.

Meanwhile, the bugs crawled farther and farther afield and I found them in weird places. They were certainly setting up new nests as I found one later under my computer chair, and then a small one in my sleeping bag right by my feet. The technicians have never been back since the two times in three months. I don't know if that is the landlord's fault or the fault of US Pest, but this much is clear: US Pest is not responsible or ethical enough to live up to their contract to eliminate pests. When they became aware that my infestation was established and pervasive, they needed to evaluate and offer a full inspection and treatment of the entire unit, rather than a minimal spritzing of random locations.

As I mentioned, this problem is not mine alone. It affects practically everyone else in my sixty-unit complex. Not all of them have notified the landlord and not all of them have done it in writing, so we are getting lousy service from two sources here. US Pest needs to wake up, smell the coffee, and insist on a thorough, expensive treatment of all the units in order to truly abate these infestations once and for all.

The onus here has been completely on me to search and destroy infestations manually. My housing inspector agreed that only a professional treatment will abate the infestation completely. Bed bugs are notoriously hard to get rid of, and I will only achieve that by working closely with a truly professional exterminator service, which US Pest is not.",6,90yx7vf32xMTfa6hEISt8Q

This place doesn't disappoint. When you arrive, expect to be in line for about 45min to a 1hr. If it is a hot day, it will feel like it is longer.  I am not sure how it is on weekdays, but on a Saturday we were in line for about this amount of time. 

The best things to order are the ribs, rib tips, brisket, and hot links. The meat is delicious and one of the Best in Vegas. If you are looking for some good home-cooked bbq, please visit this place, you will not be disappointed. It will be well worth the drive. 

The location of this place is closest to Gowan and Thom which is basically near Craig Rd and Decatur, that is in the northwest area of the valley. You will know when you are there when you see a bunch of cars parked on the ranch. They have tables outside where you can eat and chill too. 

However, if you order the chicken, order an additional meat or get the 2-3 meat combo because the chicken is on the small side for the amount of money you are paying. If you are trying to share a meal, or want to have leftovers, you will need to pair the chicken with another meat to do so. Moreover, if you get the brisket and rib tips combo, it will be enough for two or three days and it will also be more than enough to share with others. 

The side dishes are plentiful when you get them with the combo plate. If you want additional sides, they are very small and a bit over priced. Even though this place is pricey, the food quality does average this out. 

Overall, I give this place 4.5 stars because it is a good place to go for home cooked meals. Staff is nice and friendly. Very relaxed environment and family-oriented atmosphere.",2,sXCTBL0SfvucNjNnGejIEA

-Knowledge. The staff was not knowledgeable nor had access to data about the specific states (Utah and Nevada) I was filing under. I had to look up on my smartphone the tax rate in Utah, which I'm not even sure if we got right. I feel that I did all of the legwork and my tax specialist did not offer any insights or specific knowledge of tax code that would make it better than me filing myself. 

-Unnecessary Time Spent. Spent a long time going through all of my possible deductions, even though it was clearly apparent that we were under the $12k automatic adjustment. We made this clear in the beginning of our meeting, so I was frustrated our tax specialist spent all this time just to show us we didn't meet it.

-Pricing. It seems that prices have gone up since last year. I talked with a few friends who also use H&R Block who all agreed prices seemed higher than normal.

-Office. The office in Las Vegas, Nevada did not have its AC running. It was probably 85 degrees in the office, and keeping a one-year-old happy in this type of environment was nearly impossible. 

Overall I was really dissatisfied and will likely not return to H&R Block again. I felt that the service I received was not worth what I paid.",1,--HCoE1ghaAlcaAfshICgw

I waited at least 5 minutes to be acknowledged and seated, as the host was no where to be found.  Not a great first impression for a first time customer.  

We were seated and were promptly brought out water and menus.  Since I always get the green curry, Thai hot, and my daughter always orders the chicken skewers, we put out order in before other people had even ordered.  I requested that both dishes come out at the same time since she was eating an appetizer as an entrée.  Her order was brought out 15 minutes later, and mine came out a good 10 minutes after that.   Let me say that I was less than happy, since other tables that ordered well after I did were already being served.  

The curry was good, but was not the best that I've had.  Lacking eggplant if you ask me, but the amount of vegetables was great.  They did Thai spice very well too, as it cleared my sinuses in no time flat.  The portions are very large, definitely enough to share or bring home for another large meal the next day.  The chicken skewers were decent, cold by the time my dish came out though, so my (very picky) daughter hardly touched them after that.

As for the staff, let's just say their personalities were literally the most bland I've ever experienced.  Christ almighty, couldn't get a smile out of any of them...and I'm quite pleasant and fun!  They all seemed like they hated their job, hated life, and at any moment one of them would pull a 12 gauge from the back and start picking off staff and customers before ending it all!  

Not sure if I would come back here...the restaurant is beautiful, the food is pretty good, but aside from the great ambiance, it was lacking, to say the least.  Plus, they play terrible indie electronica music, which, between you and I, makes me think I should be in a gay bar, rather than an upscale Thai restaurant.

Eat here or don't, but you can get better service, food, in almost as pretty of a restaurant that plays authentic Thai music over @ Siam Thai (50th and northern).",1,8xLnR9z_Vk8RXl1uh5fT1A

They have one of those conveyor belts for the sushi if you sit at the bar.  We took a table and ordered off the menu.  We both got bento boxes.

First came the miso soup.  It had a strong flavor, and was salty.  Not my favorite.

The chicken Katsu in the bento was pretty good.  The teriyaki chicken had a sort of charred taste to it.  I didn't really like it.  The ""steak"" strips were almost flavorless.  Yes, they tasted like beef but very weakly.  Kinda strange.  I didn't try the cucumber salad stuff.  My wife likes that sort of thing so I gave it to her.  She seemed to like it.  I did eat the sushi pieces that were included.  Very little flavor there also.  The calamari salad was a pile of calamari on top of a pile of leaves (spinach, I think).  The calamari was cooked properly, not too tough or chewy, and the flavor was fine.

The Bake House is a wholesaler for Cheesecake Factory Cheesecakes and Dream Factory cupcakes (affiliated with Cheesecake Factory). They are located in the industrial area behind Dragon Legend restaurant near the Markham Costco. The products are frozen. You cannot buy individual slices of cheesecake. They sell whole cheesecakes, cupcakes, and fresh daily-made macarons prepared on site (they distribute their macarons to Loblaws and other downtown purveyors).

You can buy a 6"" cheesecake for $15-$18. They have their ""Grand Selection"" which includes 4 different pre-selected flavours of cake slices, which sells for $20. Larger 10"" cheesecakes are available for $45. I came on a Monday and was looking for the Crazy Red Velvet cheesecake but they were out . I was told they get regular shipments during the week, and if you give them 1-2 days advanced notice, they will have your desired cake flavour on hand. 

I came away with a 10 pack of mini red velvet cupcakes for $10, a 6"" white chocolate raspberry cheesecake for $18, and one dozen macarons (an assortment of pistachio, salted caramel, & hazelnut) for $20. The brother and sister owners even gave me samples of their cinnamon heart macaron and their chocolate mint macaron. I inhaled these samples when I got home. The macarons have the right chewiness and and crispy shell exterior. And for the wholesale price of $1.66 per macaron, this will be my new go-to place to satisfy any macaron cravings.

The Bake House has been open for 2 years as an exclusively wholesale location, but in Autumn 2015 they started advertising and opening their doors to the public.  They are open Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm.

It was an interpretation of the Salvador Dali painting Swans Reflecting Elephants done by Stephanie Flannery. Before scheduling my appointment, I did almost eight months of research to find the place that best suited me. There are so many tattoo shops in Phoenix that are amazing, and so many that are horrendous. For me, the environment and vibe the shop had made a huge impact on my decision. I wanted to be as comfortable as possible while sitting through a four hour tattoo and I knew some poorly lit, dingy tattoo shop with rap music blasting wasn't going to provide me with that. After visiting the Golden Rule it was a breath of fresh air. There was so much natural lighting, the space was open, it looked clean, and the aesthetic fit my lifestyle. Shortly after my visit with my parents, my dad pulled up a special Arizona Highways (yes we record it every week) did on the shop so I could gain a little more information about the shop and their philosophy. What I appreciated most was how insistent they were on being considered an art shop, not just a tattoo shop. I thought that was really cool just because it goes to show how seriously they take their work and how much effort and thought they put into it. Skipping forward to the day of my appointment, I was terrified. Not being the best at tolerating pain (I cried for thirty minutes after I got my nose pierced) anxiety overcame me. Stephanie was so sweet and patient and made me feel very confident in what I was doing. They let my dad and girlfriend sit in with me so they could document and send my mom pictures. The entire session took about 3.5 hours and I didn't take any breaks! The pain wasn't nearly as bad as I thought and I think that had a lot to do with the environment I was in and how kind my artist was. Bottom line, I would recommend this shop to anyone. Obviously it's pricey, but you get what you pay for. Everyone is so nice and accommodating there. If you are getting a bigger piece an appointment is required, and most artists are booked out months in advanced, but it's worth the wait. I won't go anywhere else.

My association with the relocated Dixie/Dundas Value Village began in January 2017, when I was invited to a pre-opening event because of my status as a Club Card member. It was a bit of a surprise walking in for the first time - the place was absolutely sprawling. From what I gathered at the time, this location is twice as big as the previous site across the street near the Talize.

The whole corner block has quickly turned into a hub for thrift stores - this site is now directly across the street from the Salvation Army and Talize (both of which I've spoken about in previous reviews). After visiting this Value Village frequently for the past three months, I'm confident in saying that this is now my new favorite in the city.

(As an aside, for those complaining about the lack of finds - this store was, and will continue to be, a prime target for resellers. At the pre-opening event, I watched a man run to the records section and immediately start hoarding a stack of LPs, most likely destined for eBay. It's the nature of the beast.)

The store is a bit overwhelming. Not only are there racks upon racks of clothing, but the specialty sections are surprisingly well-curated. I always make a beeline for the books whenever I come in, and I've been consistently surprised by the quality and selection of books. A thrift store is only as good as the donations it gets, and I've been impressed with the amount of content they get in. The vintage/collectible books section consistently has stuff that looks either brand-new or being sold at a significant loss (i.e. Folio Society books, signed books, Penguin collectible titles). The clothing itself is another high point - I've found everything from Brooks Brothers to Hugo Boss suits here, and a dizzying amount of shoes, jeans and other accessories.

Of course, the knick-knack section runs into the same problem as any other thrift store. Picked over and filled with broken or unusable items. To their credit, though, I almost always see employees restocking whenever I visit. I'm a bit more comfortable paying higher prices for thrifted goods when I know the selection is well-maintained and highly curated.

This Value Village has quickly turned into one of my favorite spots in the city to go thrifting at, and it's one I plan on visiting frequently for a long time to come.

9phmfcCbJPpxHGE0_lQnOQ,0,2018-07-23 18:19:05,0,IbiCBoDaw6WtXV3lraANHg,1,"Just finished driving beside a Five Star cube truck (in Calgary) and to keep up to him I had to drive 90km/hr on Memorial Drive (which has a posted 70km speed limit). As I pulled up beside the vehicle at a red light (just above Deerfoot Trail, by the zoo), I looked over and saw the gentleman with his cell phone up to his face. What makes this even more disheartening, in today's world of business. So I called on my Bluetooth the number on the van and left a message for a ""Jason"", with my name and phone number. I arrived back at work and Jason had returned my call. Well, as the Manager of 5 Star Seniors Relocators, I explained to Jason that the vehicle which I briefly caught up to was doing 90km on a 70km road, his 1st response was, ""The vehicle was empty"". He then defended the driver, by saying, that he was only doing 82km. How he knew that....... Jason was in the vehicle with the driver....OMG
Jason became very argumentative with me yelling at me that his driver was ONLY doing 82km in a 70km (on Memorial Drive). I did respond with 90km, which is exactly what his driver was travelling at. I then asked him why his driver was on his cell phone while in a running vehicle and possibly even while driving. I expressed to him that with him being a manager, that doesn't seem to be the best scenario for the employees having him as a manger and allowing them to break the law, with him beside them. Jason abruptly  hung up the phone on me. So as a consumer, who has grand parents and many of my friends have grand parents in senior's facilities, I would strongly suggest going with a different moving company. If you have used them before and something got broken, its because they drive TOO fast and don't support defensive driving techniques. As well, if you have complained and dealt with Jason, which turned out to be a negative experience, don't worry because ignorance is probably his only trait and as a business owner, I would have never hired a person of such poor business manners and extremely poor ethics. Five Star Seniors Relocators is a terrible company to deal with, simply because they employ Jason and are extremely poor decision makers when it comes to hiring/training drivers (which is the only way to transport any seniors precious belongings), in a city of 1.4 million potential customers.",0,iUQ2B7p6Df6OwRz9JwRCFQ

We had kept the birthday boy with us while eating dinner while the rest of the party got essentially the largest room this place has to offer (Room M - located in the far back of the venue, the last room to the left). Since we were rushing in for a surprise, we didn't look at the beginning at the venue and went to the room. 

Located next to Marugame Monzo, it is along with other places in one of the hardest strip malls to park at. Most of us has had multiple experiences in the difficulty of parking in this strip mall. Theres so much this strip mall offers, and not enough parking. There's tons more parking located 2 building back but theres no easy way to access it. 

Room M is the largest room they have to offer (I believe). It has 3 long tables lining the sides of the room with a large TV in the front and smaller TV to the rear. This room can easily fit 20 people with probably room to spare. Theres enough room that even with the seats filled, the center of the room Is still empty for uh ... ""entertainment"" XD This room prices at I believe $60/hour, which isn't bad if you have enough people to split but the drinks stack up. Between a few of us, we had gotten a bucket of Cass (6 bottles) and a large bottle of Lychee Soju. Seats were fairly clean but the tables would do a better cleaning. We were given complimentary French fries to each table in the room. What was surprising was the microphones are both wireless. Never had seen that in karaoke places here. And each microphone has a replaceable cover over it too. 

We had paid separately. Due to possibly the size of the room or maybe the number of people, they had placed an automatic 18% gratuity, plus the bucket and soju totaling into mid 30s, which resulted in the bill getting to mid 40s after the gratuity.

aD2Jg7z1fbCPZAfMpSjxCA,4,2016-05-31,2,j0ZNmQtEuiFlKGXgHTZd0g,3,"Highland Yard is a ""Pop-Up"" used goods mercantile selling merchandise that has been repurposed, refreshed and reimagined by pickers, designers and artists into home décor and home and garden furnishings in the latest, trendy styles and color palettes.  It is called a ""Pop-Up"" because it does not follow a 'regular' schedule or 'normal' business hours: it is only open four days a month. 

There is a theme to the merchandise, decor and setup that the designers follow each time they are open.  For instance, 'Road Trip' and 'Endless Summer' have been the first two themes.  Yet, I would classify the overall theme and style of Highland Yard as one of Shabby Chic/French Country Cottage with some Vintage and Mid-Century styles thrown in.  Alas, there is an occasional retro vintage piece or bona fide antique thrown in that could have migrated in from the sister building, Merchant Square, that adds a bit of flair to each vignette.

I visited; saw a few items that I liked, and returned a few days later, only to find that they were closed until next month.  The concept of a pop-up business is certainly fun and unique, and getting dozens of vendors to collaborate on a central theme, setup merchandise and make it marketable to sell to the public is not an easy feat.  I can understand only being open a few days of the month to allow time for a change of venue, however only being open 13% of the month does not allow for much shopping time, nor does it allow access for the uninformed spontaneous shopper passing by.  Perhaps more shopping days would be an improvement.  A pop-up requires informed visitors through interactive, friendly staff, having easy access and detailed signage throughout to create an informed following, all of which was lost on my fellow shoppers and me on two visits.

All in all, I like the idea of a rotating or changing theme and merchandise that is fresh and different; I think it is important to keep a shopping experience novel and I like the excitement that a pop-up brings, but I do feel as though there is an aura of excitement and friendliness that is missing from the staff . . .  especially given this only happens four days a month.  Also absent is a sense of pride from the business or management.  I'm not certain where this sense of pride should emanate from, but it is evident with the absence of friendly, excited staff and a tidy, clean and accessible entrance.  Improving in these customer service areas would certainly align itself with the quality of the furnishings within. 

It is worth a stop if it happens to be one those coveted days that The Yard is open.  If you enjoy this style of décor, you will probably find an item of interest making it worth your while to stop in.  Perhaps in a few months, when some of the newness wears off, I will return and visit again . . . let's just hope I choose the correct four days to do so.

Toppings were copious and cheese was plentiful but the pizza was very soggy and the toppings fell off in large chunks.

My coworker demanded I give it a second try, so he brought left over pizza to the office. I warmed up my slice in the toaster oven and chowed down. The pizza was less soggy this time but I felt like it was inferior to frozen pizza.

I was assured my insurance was accepted and they were a preferred provider. This was not the case. After the x-rays were taken the doctor suggested a full scaling as I hadn't see a dentist for a while. I figured I was already there so why not. The receptionist came in to tell me my insurance required a $50 deductible and I wouldn't be billed anything else. Maybe it was the friendly atmosphere. Or the fact I was already numbed up but I didn't put two and two together that my insurance only charges that deductible for non-preffered providers. So they were ""in network"" but they were not preferred as I was told they were. The office stuck to their word and didn't bill me for the extra my insurance didn't pay (almost three grand) . But the prices they charged my insurance company used up my whole years allotment for ONE visit..... A cleaning! What if I had an emergency? Or needed a tooth capped? I cringed at the thought of that bill. 

Do yourself and your wallet a favor and use the list your insurance says is in a preferred provider. They agree the accept a lower billing from the dentist in turn charging you less.

They make the pizza in front of you, all fresh.  

The process seems a little clunky but if it works, no need to monkey around with the flow.  They do need to upgrade to take Apple or google pay.

Staff was funny and chatty.

She offered to replace the strawberries, but at this point I didn't want more strawberries concerned I would get more of the same.  I asked if I could get either bananas, pineapple or apples.  They had a box for less money with a mix of strawberries, bananas and pineapple, which I was interested in.  She explained they had been so busy over the weekend they had NO fruit.  This was after 12 in the afternoon, surely they should have gotten a delivery and if not for emergencies run to the grocery store right next door.  I said it didn't have to be today but I guess they never expected another delivery of fruit ever again.  She said the only thing she could do was refund the person who paid which was my mother in law.  I hung up and called my mother in law and told her I loved her idea but they were horrible and they would be contacting her for info so they could refund her.  It's now five days later and no one has called her for the refund and I never got anything edible.  They are liars and thieves.

There's outdoor and indoor seating, but with summer temps in Vegas, indoor makes a lot more sense. It's an open-concept kitchen and the inside of the place feels nice and open, but nothing remarkable.

Positives
+They had a whole menu of some non-alcoholic cocktails for $3. That price is spectacular!
+Our friend got the sangria flight (generous servings), which was also well-priced, and each one looked truly unique. 
+Menu is big and well-marked (vegetarian), etc. There's something for everyone.
+Service was excellent. Our water was attentive, friendly and very funny. Water and drinks were consistently refilled.
+Water is served with a lemon automatically - it's the little things!
+Pizza is extremely thin crust and has LOTS of veggies on the veggie pizza. This shouldn't be a surprise, but many places skimp.
+It only costs $1 to add an egg to a pizza.
+Roasted veggie salad had a good variety of veggies (artichokes, sundried tomatoes, olives, etc.). Negative is there was still A LOT of lettuce.

Negatives
-Guacamole was VERY small and more like a bit of diced avocado.
-It's still CPK. The menu, while seeming a bit bigger than other CPKs, was still pretty standard CPK. We left full and satisfied, but it is still a chain.
-Location is a bit remote in terms of other things on the strip. You need to seek this out a bit more.

The place was happening. I realized later its a franchise in the city. I ordered one of their few vegetarian options, a grilled cheese sandwich with grilled mushrooms. And a side of cajun spiced fries. Both were stupendously good (and stupendously unhealthy). My grilled cheese consisted of two slices of 'bread' (more like savoury pancakes) with heaping amounts of cheese and mushrooms dripping out. The serving size was smallish (imagine a slightly overstuffed egg mcmuffin) but very filling. In comparison they overfilled my serving of fries (and I ate every single one...oh what a carb feast).

The 2nd time today I had to choose one or the other and went with the southwestern  chicken salad with the dressing on the side. It actually reminds me of Oreganos Pablo Picasso salad (one of my favorites). Different chicken of course but somewhat same flavors with the peppers, onions and jalapeños on it and a much more manageable size for one person.

I can not express how much I value my life and that of my children and how little they value the lives of the patients. If you truley love yourself and want what is best for your children never deliver at Mountain View. If your insurance tells you, you have to deliver there.... Pay out of pocket and go somewhere else. Your life is worth way more then a bill. I was told that was the only place close to my home that my doctor would deliver at.
I was 35 weeks pregnant when I went into Mountain View with some pressure and not feeling right. They checked me out, said I had a UTI and sent me home. That night everything got worse, my entire stomach was on fire and I was throwing up for over 5 hours. Again I went back to Mountain View. Where upon telling them my symptoms they told me I was deyhrated. Really... It was nice to know that they were listening to me.... Not. I had just told the nurse I was unable to keep anything down. I told them I was in alot of pain and my entire stomach was on fire. It was even hot to the touch. But no one touched me. They told me I needed to ""stick it out, it was part of pregnancy. They gave me an IV and a prescription for my UTI and sent me home. That day I researched my symptoms online. I concluded I had appendicitis. But twice I was told by medical staff that this was normal. But I knew in my heart that it wasnt. So that night I made the decision to go to another hospital. Centennial Hills. An on call doctor looked at my test results from Mountain View, he said you don't have a UTI. I was rushed into emergency surgery. I had a C-section and my appendicitis removed. I was told I would have died in a few hours if I wouldn't have gone into the hospital. After mine and my child's recovery we went back to Mountain View. They reviewed my records and the choices of the nurses and concluded they did everything they could do for me and that I did have a UTI. No we are very sorry for almost costing you your life, for our oversight and for our jumping to conclusions and ignoring what our patient is telling us. You decide for yourself. But a hospital that swears I had a UTI when in fact I had surgery to remove my appendix is not one I will ever set foot in again.

I am so thankful that I finally found a keeper.  This salon is amazing.  I had a set of acrylics put on by another salon 2 weeks ago along with a pedicure.  I was so dissappointed by the results, my nails looked like ducks feet.  The pedicure after 1 week was already chipping.  My husband was in desperate need of a pedicure and so I got on line to see what I could find based on others recommedations.  I am so thankful that I found Highlights Nails and Spa on Yelp.  My husband and I had our first appt this afternoon.  What a treat.  If you want one of the best Pedicures, treat yourself to Cindy. She was absolutely amazing and my husbands rough feet are now smooth!  Now guys, if you don't think this is for you, not manly enough, etc, my husband is one to tell you to try it.  A pedicure with a massage truly is amazing after a working on your feet.  (Guys, my hubby is as bad-ass as they get and he is sold and is going to go once a month)  Now for the rest of the experience, I mentioned my acrylic nails done by the other spa to Ali the owner.  She went and got her glasses as I was getting my pedicure, came back, took my hands and looked at my nails.  She said she could fix them.  OMG, she spent quite a bit of time working on them, they had to be completely refiled, shaped and gel put back on them. She really spent time and work on them and I have to say they haven't ever looked and felt better.  I was joking that I should have made a hair appt. as the stylist Nicole had just finished an up do on a customer that was adorable.  (My arm is in a cast right now so doing my own hair is pretty difficult), after making this comment jokinly to the owner, the next thing I know, Nicole has her straightener and blow dryer in hand and fixed my hair!  Cindy then came over and put two adorable flowers on my nails.   Brandi did my pedicure and my nails and feet feel fabulous.  I left there thinking I had just spent a luxurious day at a first class spa.  This is one of the cleanest most comfortable spas I have been to.  Their commitment to customer satisfaction is something that has been amiss at other spas in the area that I have tried.

The beer selection is awesome. For the most part, the service is on point. I've had a couple of instances where I was a little annoyed though.

One such instance is when I went through the drive thru... I pull up and ask the guy for a 4 pack of Boddingtons. He shrugs his shoulders, gives me a snotty look and asks ""what's that?"" I reply ""...it's beer, dude"" while trying to contain my laughter. I didn't think I was making such an outlandish request. And i know this guy has been working here for awhile. I see him here all the time. He says back ""ok...where is it?"" At this point I'm wondering if he's just having a shitty day or he just took a huge bong rip in the back. I tell him ""in the beer cooler, about 4 or 5 doors from the left. Top shelf. Tall yellow cans."" In my head I'm thinking ""jeez dude, want me to ring myself up too?"" He goes back, is gone for about 3 minutes, and comes back with it finally. I pay and pull away. No ""Thank You"" or anything. Sorry if I was insulting your intelligence, but you seriously don't know where your own product is located? Does someone else tie your shoes for you before you leave for work? It's not like I was asking for some obscure,  triple hopped chocolate milk stout pale ale from Iran. It's Boddingtons! 
 
Another time I went in, I was followed around the store by an employee,  literally hawk - eyeing me as I was looking through their whiskey selection. I guess anyone with tattoos and a shaved head is a thief that needs to be spied on. Don't let the looks fool you, I'm not a gang member or an ex con. I'm just an honest alcoholic. 

The blonde ladies that work there need to take a Xanax and chill the f out too. I get it- you probably deal with trashy dudes all day. It's a liquor store in shitty mesa. But if I make eye contact, smile and say hello to you and you don't say hi back, now YOU'RE the trash. Just sayin.

Sounds amazing, right?? Well it might have been but the whole meal was super salty. I could only choke down about half before giving the rest to someone else.

I wanted a quick car wash as I had my 1 year old daughter with me, the guy at the beginning of car wash pressured me into a full detail because of the deals. I told him I didn't care about what was included in the cost and I just wanted a ""quick"" clean because I didn't have time to spend because of my baby. He said he was a dad, he understood, he would rush my car and it would be done in half an hour - 45 minutes tops. So I spend $60 and one hour and 45 minutes later with a cranky, hungry toddler in tow my car is ""done"". I just wanted to get out of there and with the amount of time I spent I figured they cleaned it very well. Well now I'm home and those kids that do car washes for fundraising could have done a better job for $5. The bottom of my car is still muddy, they did not even touch my gear shift where there is still dirt and my dash is dusty! My rear window has a hand smudge mark and I swear there's a new ding on my passenger side door. If you guys think they do a good job you've obviously never had your car done anywhere else. I will never go back here again and will drive an extra 20 minutes to Oasis at the Shell on Pecos and Flamingo. For 1/3rd of the cost you get quality service from people who pay attention to detail.",4,FhVs0PtuJHJYa1A7ZIfISA

They were very diligent in checking the health of our eyes. Both my daughter and I needed to have our prescriptions corrected. Upon viewing the changes I was so relieved with the new lenses/glasses I was getting. I really felt like they went over and beyond to meet my needs and maintain my vision healthy, and my daughter agreed that she loved the attention we got.
They really know their insurance partners, and they made sure to apply all the available co-pays  and discounts for us.

Everything else about our dining experience was less than desirable, bordering on pretty bad. We ordered a simple cheese calzone and a Holy Shiitake mushroom pizza - easy enough. We waited a full 60 minutes for the food to come out, and that was after we had to approach the hostess stand to ask about the status of our food, since our waitress had avoided our table for 25 minutes. Finally, we got our food, and asked for the check immediately because we weren't in the mood to wait for another hour for that. It was then we noticed we were charged for a large pizza when we had ordered a medium. The manager fixed the bill, but was very nonchalant about the whole experience, as was the server. Overall, the food was decent, but for being a mushroom pizza boasting at least 3 kinds of mushrooms, there were hardly any on our pizza.

When compared to the other taco places around, I would say this one is better! I love that they have the all sorts of choices for tortillas, flour or corn, crispy or soft. We went with the soft corn tortillas. I had the Fresco taco, the Barbacoa taco, and the grilled fish taco. All of them were simple, but done well. They didn't have exotic ingredients, but I really think that made them better. The tacos came with chips to eat with the SALSA BAR! Generally, the chips and salsa is one of the best parts of going to a Mexican restaurant, right? Well this place you get many salsa choices and you get as much as you want. This is the best idea ever. I liked all the salsas, they were flavorful. I also liked that they had an interesting assortment of hot sauces to choose from. The place was clean and the prices were fair. They also have a happy hour which I did not partake in, but seems like next time that might be fun. We will absolutely be back.

We waited and waited and finally here came our 25 anniversary celebration on July 5.  Our expereince started with a smiley beautiful lady giving us a brief introduction of the history and design of the restaurant.  We were told that this steak house is the one Chef Ramsay freqently visits.  It rasied our hope that the food MUST be outstanding.  Our waiter is escellent.  Very friendly, attentive and informative.  Gave us good recommendations on drinks and food choices.   The bread selection was good, foie gras was excellent and the seafood tower was amazing.  But we were totally disappointed when the Kobe beef steak (8oz) and the Royal Long Horn steak came.  We ordered medium rare and medium respectively but both of them apeared to be burnt, especially with the Kobe  beef.  This dish will definitely be sent back to kitchen if Chef Ramsay was on site, REGARDLESS of the value!  We expected the famous Kobe beef to have marble texture and melt in the mouth but it was chewy and blend.  We had Kobe beef steak in Japan before and that was way better.  The Long Horn steak was slightly overcooked too. The sticky toffe pudding which came with the butter ice-cream matched beautifully, however, the coffee we picked was another disappointment.  It's worse than a donut shop coffee !.  Our bill was almost $800 for 3 but with that qualify of entree we had, totally not worth it.  Again, we believe, according to what we saw on TV about Chef Ramsay's high standard and requirements,  he would never allow the entree to leave the kitchen.  After all, the whole dinning experience was like riding a roller coaster ended with a sad face :(",0,b1qKCVkKman3AD1IVm2wfA

She puts our order in and they bring out the first sushi dish which was a California Roll and based on the presentation it wasn't up to par what we normally saw when going to any sushi Japanese restaurant. It had no wasabi on the plate or ginger we had to ask for it. Some guy brought us the wasbai on the side and we asked more than once for the ginger and we never got it. Two different servers kept passing by us seeing we had one napkin each and when all the food came out they should've brought more napkins but they didnt. They only brought the rest of the food out and came back once and asked how was everything we didnt even answer. They never bothered to ask if we needed a refill on drinks or more napkins.

I like to bring friends and family here. I enjoy the ambiance, the food, and the service.  The prices are right and I will continue to frequent this establishment. 

Let's get down to the details... 


Ambiance: 

Lazy Dog offers a casual and easy-going dining experience.
Dog inspired decor everywhere (don't forget to check out the restroom signs).  
They have a great patio that is dog friendly. 
Choose to sit on the patio. It is a great option in the Fall/Winter/Spring in Las Vegas (they have heaters for chilly nights)

Tip: Don't like dogs? Don't sit on the patio. 
 
Food: 

I've been here breakfast, lunch, dinner, and happy hour. 
I've been happy with everything I've tried. 
I've tried a lot more than what I listed. 
I take coworkers, family and friends here. 
It's a solid crowd pleaser with an extensive menu. 
They speckle the menu with a few seasonal dishes to keep things fresh. 

Here are a few of my favorite items I've tried. 

Wild Blueberry Pancakes (brunch menu)
Yum. I really liked that they loaded it with blueberries (my favorite).

Beer Battered Fish n' Chips (lunch/main menu)
I've had it for lunch (smaller portion). I liked it and they even bring vinegar for my fries. It also comes with apple cider vinegar slaw. 

Butter Cake (sweet tooth menu)
This is a butter cake topped with a strawberry and mint compote with vanilla bean ice cream and splash of balsamic. It was fantastic! 

Edamame (small plates- main menu) 
It was  spicy and delicious with a hint of citrus notes. 

Seared Ahi Tuna (main menu)
This sesame Ahi Tuna Steak is served over mashed cauliflower (don't knock until you give it a whirl).  It's topped with a light coconut curry sauce and is under 500 calories. It's delicious! I've ordered this at least 3 times.. 


Hummus Trio (starter) 
This is exactly what you think it is. A trio of hummus. A walnut-pesto, sundried tomato and traditional classic hummus. These are served with toasted garlic bread , sliced cucumbers, and tomatoes. They will also bring more bread and veggies is you ask with a smile (say cheese).  


Cocktails: 
Moscow Mule:
This is a solid choice. This is what I normally order. 
I like the fact that they have a clean cocktail menu.
The clean cocktail menu offers tasty drinks that are low on calories/sugar. 
They have list of drinks under 175 calories that are made with no artificial ingredients. 


Wild Blueberry Lemon Drop:
Another one of their clean cocktails under 175 calories that are made with no artificial ingredients. I loved this drink, too! 

Mango Chile Margarita 
My Mom and Husband's go to when they're here. 


Service: 
Their service has always been super friendly and efficient. 
They usually have a manager walking the floor checking in on tables (always a welcomed gesture). Servers have always offered their opinion when asked to about their favorite menu items. 

Overall, this is a solid 4.5/5 star establishment in my book!

It's your responsibility to help us set this stuff up especially when you offered and you said it's free?

If there was another store in town I would consider going there and see if they are better at customer service.

I travel to Italy almost yearly -- no joke -- just to drink a proper espresso. That's why I get really, REALLY annoyed when I go to a coffee shop and order a macchiato and the snot-nosed, know-it-all, eye rolling barista behind the counter immediately says in a sarcastic tone,""it's traditional and not like Starbucks"" like they are some kind of espresso Yoda. Um, look obnoxious hipster, I KNOW what I am ordering. I wouldn't be in your coffee shop in the first place if I didn't!

I witnessed this super snobby attitude towards several other patrons who ordered after me. There were obviously black-clad regulars who got much more respect from the girl behind the counter. 

All of the insufferable coffee culture buzzwords are here, from ""drip"" coffee (all coffee drips, morons!) to special ""nitrogen brews"" (OMG shoot me NOW)! Look, I make fun of people who order those fake frou-frou drinks at Starbucks and wax poetic about how much they ""truly love coffee"" but these types of menu items even annoy the heck out of ME! Ordering a cup of coffee shouldn't come with a judgmental class system and I feel that is what Mothership has going on here.

I drink my espresso in strong ristretto shots and I like it black 'cause I don't mess around. So when I tell you this stuff was bitter, it had to have been 1,000 times over the legal bitterness limit for the casual coffee sipper. I frantically searched for some sweetener (this is a hipster place so there's ONLY agave and raw sugar cubes -- GROAN -- on offer) but when my desperate quest turned out to be fruitless, I simply took one for the team and downed it quickly. 

I didn't partake in any of the pastries since nothing was particularly tempting. 

The interior is unwelcoming and cold too, and there's just an overall unpleasantness to the place. I did like the cute flowers on the tables at least. I hate to rate a small business too low, but I think it's more than deserving of the ding. I wouldn't go out of my way to visit this coffee shop, and I won't be returning.",16,BQkC6RneYfvfG6wRe0hsvQ

The namesake carries some heavy expectations and also prejudices for a TV personality, but this place really has done justice even on just their 2nd day of being opened. I was excited for this as a few days prior I walked by and they were having a meeting. I stood there listening in and looking through the curtain like a total creeper.  I was worried there might be a wait, being a famous name, and brand new. I did try to call, but had a hard time getting to them and decided to come chance it anyways. It was busy, but there was no wait to be seated when we came at 5ish.

The menu is a cheeky paper menu that they encourage you to take as a souvenir, if you wish. With us being a bit of fans, yes, I took mine home. *blush*. Some people might be confused with the two different pricing but the orange is for Total Rewards members of PH Hotel&Casino so before dining, go get a card for a savings of $1 off per each item you order. 

The Farm Burger - this was a rather good burger if you like something to showcase natural flavors than big zesty spicy accompaniments. You can tell the meat quality is top notch and the flavor on it is fantastic. We did order a medium rare but it was more on the medium side, just a small oversight. The duck bacon was a curiousity, but basically just like bacon, just less fatty than pork. The brioche bun was so lovely soft and had a perfect flavor and toast to the inside. The egg is always a good flavor with beef. It needed a tad something to tie it all together so put some of the chipotle or curry ketchup on it! It isn't a huge burger, but trust we were full splitting all our items and I can tuck in and eat. 

Fresh roasted chili dawg - so the beef ""devil dawgs"" are cooked in a hellfire hot sauce and then grilled. I would rarely say a hot dog is gourmet or worth paying for, but this was seriously good. Fuck Pinks next door (its not like the one in LA anyways), and get this instead! I love the crispy texas toast like hot dog bun it was on and the dog was snappy, and super juicy and does taste of hotsauce it was cooked in! The toppings of the jalapeno, roasted fresno peppers, avocado, onion, cheddar and chipotle mayo were perfect with it. 

Just Fries - these were lovely skin on fries. I read in a press junket they use a specific more fluffy potato and do the 3 step fry method. These were crisp yet fluffy, not thick but not thin either and for me that's the ideal fry. The chipotle and curry ketchups were both very good, I didn't have a favorite. I just alternated every other fry.  

Shake # 5 - they split ours up for us which was a nice move on their service. This was rich and so good. I love the texture and flavor contrast between the shake and the swirl of pudding they put. This one was chocolate hazelnut pudding with coffee shake and a awesome praline cookie thin. It didn't taste too much like hazelnuts though, but more like chocolate caramel pudding but still good. It was good to split, it would have been too much for me to do one whole. 

Service was super friendly, personable and attentive. Much more cohesive than I would expect of a newbie restaurant. They asked how we heard of them, hows our day going, explained the menu, etc as we sat down and browsed. Our drinks were filled without ever asking and we were checked on a few times to see how we are doing. Their uniforms here are something else. Ladies are very form fitting and short so there's a eyecandy element to this place. After ordering our food did take a while to get to us so we sat around for a bit. Still, I would rather have it cooked right than rushed to where standards are lowered. 

Very satisfied with this meal and will be returning absolutely! Of course on principle I do reserve 5 stars for consistency upon return visits, but this is a highly recommended 4 stars.

The three pureed potatoes dishes were lobster, which, while I love big chunks of lobster, tasted like an experiment on how to get starchy potatoes and a bag of white flour into a pasty goo reminiscent of gruel which clung so steadfastly to the lobster chunks that it didn't offer the opportunity to salvage them from the muck, the sour cream and chive version, almost as gooey and I guess was worth one taste, and the third, horseradish, I guess was supposed to be some kind of traditional take on wasabi mashed potatoes you would have seen on every menu five years ago.

Service wasn't anything to brag about either. This is another one of those places where they really need to train their waitstaff a little better.

I visited with a friend and her kids and they already had a table ready for us as we walked in the door (the server had seen us getting out of the car).

To start our meal, we were served Cinnamon Chips with a Banana Nutella Dip to start and whoa, this was beyond delicious. The chips were light and crispy (there were other seasonings as well, however, I can't remember what they were) and the dip was fantastic. I believe this is served during breakfast/brunch only?

At the urging of another patron, my friend ordered their coffee and it was very tasty! I had found out where they get their coffee, but of course, I can't remember and I don't know where I had seen or heard it. Either way, I've seen people raving about the coffee in multiple reviews, so the coffee is a must.

I like the uniqueness of the menu and the play on classics; that's my favorite type of dishes. So, obviously, there was so much I wanted to try! Even though we were there during breakfast, they still offered their lunch menu (so awesome).

Corned Beef Bread Pudding Benedict ($17): Fresh marble rye bread pudding, corned beef hash, poached eggs, and hollandaise. I was the most excited about this plate because it bascially combines my favorite foods into ONE MEGA DISH. The bread pudding was a really cool because it was made to be more savory and the rye gave it a nice distinctive flavor. The corned beef hash was very tasty and had a nice crust. The ""benedict"" of poached eggs and hollandaise rounded out this neat combination. The eggs were inconsistently cooked; one was a decent poach whereas the other one was way overdone (no runny yolk). Anyway, this dish was absolutely delicious and something I'd order again! Side note: I just realized the menu says it's served with breakfast potato, but I didn't get anything.

LongSiLog ($13): Filipino breakfast; three eggs, Longanisa (sausage), garlic fried rice, Atchara (pickled papaya), and vinegar sauce. A traditional Filipino breakfast with its own mash-up of a name; Longanisa, Sinangag (fried rice) and Pritong Itlog (fried egg). Though I have experience with longanisa and garlic fried rice, the combination of ingredients and flavors was new to me. The overall flavor profile I got was ""vinegar-y"" and almost sour because of the pickling and sauce. I didn't really love it, but it is a good dish and I'm sure if you grew up with LongSiLog, this is a welcomed comfort meal.",9,TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ

The menu is interesting in that this is a japanese fusion place so they have everything from ramen to waffles with bulgogi, I like interesting, hence the excitement, unfortunately where it really mattered they were lacking.
We started with the braised pork belly slices, I was so excited and consequently somewhat let down. The flavor was good, not great but good, I prefer my pork belly a little crisp, here, the meat was soooo tender you can barely pick it up.. there was sauce and meat chucks everywhere.. lol I thought it was just me but noted that several others who tried the dish also had the same issue. 
I finished with sesame tonk ramen and this is where my sadness really crept in. I like my ramen savory, hot and tasty.. here it was... bleh, warm and needed more flavor. The seaweed while good overwhelmed the dish which was disappointing because that is primarily all I could taste.

But I digress...

I got the dress last weekend and it was satin and sumptuous. I put it on and... a tad snug in the hips and my girls are swimming in at the bust (and it's not like I'm exactly small up top). GREAT! And I only need to wear it... FRIDAY! I looked all over the place to find reliable and fast alteration shops. Then I remembered this little place because it's in a plaza about five minutes away from my job. What the heck? Besides, I didn't have time to drive all over Greater Phoenix in the hopes of finding someone to fix the mess that was my dress. I took the dress in to AZ Alterations Monday afternoon. It's a simple, tidy little shop and the woman who helped me was sweet and upfront. She told me they could fix the bust with no problem, but letting anything out in the hips would likely result in little holes in the satin, along the seam, from where the thread had originally been sewn. It wasn't worth the risk, so I asked her to just take in the bust. (Insert crash diet and body shaper here.) She told me it would be $45, since it would have to be a rush job, but that it would likely be done Wednesday, so we would have time to make any last-minute adjustments. A tad pricey, in my opinion, but I had to consider the type of material, the fact that she had to deal with the zipper and keep that straight, and that I needed it expedited.  As promised, she called me on Wednesday and I went right over to try on the dress. Not even the man who rammed his car into the side of mine as I was driving through the plaza could stop me! It slowed me down and required that I make an additional stop at a body shop and a rental car place right after I left AZ Alterations, but it didn't stop me!!! Yeah, that's right... *nodding slowly and raising my left eyebrow bad-assededly*

When I finally got there (after exchanging insurance information with my parking lot  archnemesis in the Mazda who clearly tried to ruin my afternoon... OK, he didn't really ""try"", but still...) and tried it on, it was still gapping a bit at the bust, so the seamstress said she would make an additional fix and that I could come back and get it before the store closed. Now the bust is a perfect fit. And even though I didn't bother to fuss with the hips for fear of jacked up result, that part fits great now, too, especially after not having any carbs since Monday, and buying the ""almost life-threatening"" level body shaper. All in all it was a great experience and the dress fits like a dream! Just be sure you watch out when you drive to get there because traffic in that plaza can be a nightmare. 

FYI, the shop's business card says they do ""alterations for men, women & children... casual, evening, wedding & much more."" They also do dry cleaning.",1,Nkyg8jwDxyEPNaaPoeyE1w

As I've mentioned in my review of A Cookie and a Cupcake, I usually prefer the sugary frosting to the smooth buttercream. Not here. Yeeeccckk! It was too sugary and hard. It was also disproportionate to the cupcake and fell off almost immediately.

I sampled four cupcakes (and felt like one of the cool kids for getting there before they sold out): chocolate chip, vanilla, chocolate raspberry, and cookies and cream. I'd say the cookies and cream was the best, followed by chocolate chip, chocolate raspberry, and poor vanilla came last. First of all, the vanilla cake is too spongy and too sweet. Then the vanilla frosting is just awful. I mean, not TRULY awful but only in the way a cupcake can actually be awful. Soo sweet and had this weird texture. The chocolate frosting was great. The chocolate cake was also great. So next time I'll probably try the chocolate cupcake, which has the best combination of cake and frosting. I agree with Krystal that the cookies and cream frosting was amazing. Unlike her, though, mine was on a chocolate cupcake, which I'm sure made it infinitely better.

They were pretty friendly in there, but not genuinely so, more like ""Hi! Our cupcakes rule! You are LUCKY to be here!"" etc. Like the cupcakes themselves, too sweet to be taken seriously.",3,Ytjon2aVUm09CMdfGJxZYg

I don't really remember.

The pizza wasn't great and the pizza wasn't bad.  The crust was a medium thickness with a sweeter sauce and not as much cheese as I like.  I remember thinking that around $20 for a large cheese pizza seemed like too much.  As I was moving the day I got the pizza, delivery would have been really nice.  The storefront was standard pizza store.  But, kids, that's it.

Book a tour in advance, this is the only way you can visit the museum. You can book student tickets online just be sure to bring your student ID with you when you visit. Our tour guide was so nice, I have her to thank for leading us to the Container Park which is located on Fremont and 7th, a five minute walk from the casino madness also on Fremont and 4th. 

Las Vegas is full of history, most of it has been forgotten due to old hotels being taken down and rebuild by new owners and developers. The folks at Neon Museum do their best in getting their hands on as many Neon signs as possible in hopes to preserve them and hopefully to restore them back to life. You'll learn all this and a lot more if you visit the Neon Museum and go on the tour. The one thing I wish was that they'll let you take photos after or before the tour, but because there are so many tours one after another they don't let you. Super clean and cute facility. 

Nevada recognizes the Neone Museum's efforts in preserving Las Vegas's history and now has their back and helps them out every way that they can. One way they help out is by renting them their land for $1 a year so they can use the money from ticketing, the gift shop, and donations towards running the museum and preserving these marvelous pieces of art. The passion and love from the entire staff is touching, you just know you're visiting a place that is important to the state. There were more locals than tourists on our tour, which tells me it has more cultural significance than tourism... you can also rent out a private lot in the back for weddings or private events. 

Tickets are extremely reasonably priced. $18 for adults and $12 for students. Parking is free. It's a private non profit.

Tips: We went on a day time tour at 3pm, we kind of wish we had booked it a little later around 4pm due to the heat. There are umbrellas they will loan you for free for your tour, you leave your ID with them in exchange. Family friendly. Only a few of the signs work at night, the photos come out better during the day time. Walk in is ok, but they recommend booking in advance, depending on how booked the tours are you could walk in and hop on a tour or they might book you for the following day.  If you want to expand your neon experience visit Fremont and be sure to goto the Container Store, The Writers Block, and check out the Downtown Podcast.",4,0-9YVzOkL51P7rtlaLBp9g

This location is noticibly better than their other locations.

We asked about the complimentary salad that used to be a part of the main dish we ordered and even though we were told that they have discontinued it, and they don't even offer Parmesan cheese because (manager's quote: ""cheese price has gone up"") with pasta, they made an exception for our table and gave us free salads.
We had 3 different guys coming up to our table asking how the food is. Honestly, the food was good, but it was quite average. It can get really annoying when they keep asking the same question over and over, while you're trying to talk with your friends and eat.

Came here on a date and yes, I do agree with a fellow Yelper that it IS a big spacious restaurant so it doe not give you the intimate, romantic/family style a Italian restaurant should be. But hey...it's located in a 5 diamond hotel right ON THE STRIP...what else can you expect?

To sum it up, everything we ordered was delicious. The service was great, our waiter was attentive the entire time keeping our drinks filled, napkins/utensils were delivered quick. 
We got an order of their famous meatballs as an appetizer. I believe it came with six. Perfect to start off with. The meatballs were very flavorful and they weren't puny little meatballs either.
For our entrees, I ordered chicken Parmesan and my date ordered a pasta dish. Let me tell you, like most restaurants here on the strip, portions were pretty big. I definitely had leftovers for the next day. My chicken Parmesan wasn't dried and they put the perfect amount of melted cheese on top. 
We also ordered dessert. Not a big fan of sweets to begin with and I was already full from dinner. But my date suggested we share something soooo....sure, why not? We ordered the canoli and it was wayyy toooo sweet for my liking. The cream filling....bleh....over powering. I much prefer a gelato or something if I ever get a chance to come back here.

Overall, this is a really good restaurant and I can see it thriving here at The Palazzo. Prices aren't as expensive as say, Dal Toro or Bouchon. If you're in the mood for Italian and kind of on a budget.....I definitely recommend Buddy V's.

If you are planning to try this place, MY RECOMMENDATION IS TO GO ELSEWHERE!  For our entrees, my mother ordered the chicken risotto, and I ordered the pasta primavera.  The entrees arrived way to soon, about 5 minutes after our salads were served.  Every fine dining restaurant knows to allow enough time between the salad and entrée.  No one wants to eat their salad, while their entrée is getting cold.  Then, the chef, who only had one other customer besides us, screwed up both meals!  He made my mother's chicken risotto without chicken (when it doesn't even come that way), and he added chicken to my (vegetarian) pasta primavera.  It was obvious that the chef was very inexperienced and had no idea what he was doing!  My pasta primavera was swimming in olive oil, and my mother's risotto was extremely watery.  All SEASONED chefs understand that risotto should be cooked until all the liquid is absorbed!  Also, everyone knows, that when you screw up two meals at a fine dining restaurant, you offer the guests either free dessert, a free appetizer, or you comp their meals.  We were offered no compensation what-so-ever for the chefs mistake!  It was clear to me that the employees at Slate Bistro have no idea how to properly handle problems at their restaurant.  We were also very disappointed with the dessert selections.  They did not have any of the traditional fine dining desserts you would expect such as tiramisu, crème brulee, and cheesecake.

I took them to go and started to warm up the quiche.  I had intended the pinwheel to be a dessert of sorts, but I was too hungry to wait.  My first bite was also my last.  It tasted dry, stale, and it wasn't even sweet.  I was very disappointed.

The quiche was individual sized, and there were quite a few options in the shop that would have been perfect for lunch.  But I felt the bacon would be most appropriate for breakfast.  I was very happy that the quiche was miles better than the pastry.  In fact, I was half tempted to go get a second!  But I don't think it was quite good enough to make up for it.

Herein lies one of my big pet peeves with bar and restaurant staff that use a soda gun. First of all, the Pepsi was $2.50 for a standard size glass. Fine. After I was finished my poutine, nearly done my Pepsi, and my friend was about 2/3 done his beer the waitress took the empty plate and asked if I wanted ""a refill"" on my pop. I looked at the glass thinking we'd be leaving soon but figured while she's there and asking I might as well so said, ""sure, why not"". When the bill came I was charged for two Pepsis. Now aside from the fact that that is just plain cheap - considering the actual cost of the drink is about 5-cents - it's rather irritating. I would not have accepted the offer of ""a refill"" had I been aware that I would be charged. Generally, if I say I would like ""another one"" I expect to pay. If it's ""a refill"", the assumption is that they are refilling the glass that I already paid for. Whatever. Now I know. And you do too.

There's usually a surprise ""hey this one thing we did wasn't covered by your insurance"" on the way out (2/3 of the last times I've been I think, different things each time). It would be cool if they let me know that before they did the procedure.

I love beaver tails. For those of you who don't know what a beaver tail is, it is usually a sweet dessert that involves deep frying a piece of dough and spreading whatever you like on top. Usually my go-to beaver tails are with Nutella or just the plain old cinnamon and sugar! Both are amazing and I've had them for many years now.

I wanted to try something new today so I got the beaver bites. Instead of like a flat piece of fried dough, they're like bite size balls of beaver tails - it's basically fried dough. Then, you get the option of gelato or frozen yogurt on top of that and there are more flavours of gelato at this location than frozen yogurt (vanilla, chocolate, or mix/swirl). I got the frozen yogurt this time (no particular reason). 

The beaver bites with frozen yogurt... I'm gonna be really honest, I thought it was going to be mind blowingly awesome but it wasn't. The beaver bites didn't really taste of anything other than fried dough, but the frozen yogurt was good. I got the vanilla frozen yogurt. Also, it's not super sweet if you're not much of a sweet tooth. You also have the option of putting caramel or chocolate sauce on top. I believe the chocolate sauce is Nutella but I'm not sure.

This is a good place to go by yourself and chill, go with family, friends, or even on a date!!",0,wZdO2jOHr9O8sRC9799GTQ

When I questioned that the ad said ""free estimates"" I was forwarded to another person, who said that someone would be at my home between 8 AM and 10 AM and there would be no fee.  I work nights, so it was difficult for me to get up that early, but I did.  No one had shown up by 10:15 AM.

What I was not expecting a chipotle style food selection.   We still gave it a shot and realized that the cost for three tacos was the same if you did a burrito or a bowl.   Unfortunately the wife and I picked street tacos which for the price you are better off choosing the burrito or bowl to qualify as a meal.  Three tacos is normally ok, but 2-3 pieces of dried shrimp or scant traces of asada doesn't cut it.   We've had better luck at some of the Mexican food restaurants that serve asada vs, marinated sirloin sitting in a container in its own liquid.  Again this may be deliberate to get people through the food line faster but the atmosphere of this place warrants a table service rather than a quick heating of a cold corn or flour tortilla.

STOP. talking about Kitchen Nightmares, Gordon Ramsey, and Ramsey apparently sexually assaulting his wife.  Ummm, what?

She rolled her eyes and went ""every day"".  I mean it was kind of funny because that's why I went there but come on man, I was hoping you'd just yell at me and not talk badly on Gordon Ramsey! haha.

zJCbSgXWFWwvKiIRFFuiTA,0,2014-09-09 17:36:00,0,OEhlEPvhfK3ATNZvG8-xdg,1,"I am writing in reference to the cancellation of flight 1733 from Orlando (MCO) to Phoenix (PHX) on Wednesday, July 23, and the horrible experience my family and I had with US Airways and its associated companies.
 
My confirmation code is FYT3ZL and my wife, three children and I were scheduled to travel on the previously mentioned flight.
 
The flight was originally scheduled to leave at 8:45 p.m., and we arrived at the gate at 6:30 p.m., well in advance of our boarding time.
 
Soon after our arrival at the gate, we were alerted the plane on which we would be traveling was delayed in Charlotte due to a mechanical issue. The flight was delayed several more times and, finally, at about 10:15 p.m. it was announced the flight was canceled.
 
During the delay, my wife and I struck up a conversation with an off-duty US Airways flight attendant who also was traveling to Phoenix. She was monitoring the flight status using her smartphone. What's appalling is she told us a full 30 to 45 minutes before the 10:15 p.m. gate announcement the flight was officially canceled. My question is, why didn't US Airways alert its customers immediately? Why did the official announcement come from the gate agent 45 minutes later when the decision to cancel the flight had already been made?
 
That was just the beginning of what turned out to be a horrible night.
 
The gate agent who announced the cancellation stated US Airways would be assisting people with other flight arrangements and providing hotel vouchers. He also provided a toll-free number to your reservation department to assist with the flight arrangements, which I used to schedule our flight home to Phoenix.
 
After the announcement, one line formed at the US Airways gate desk. That line included people who only needed hotel vouchers, others who chose to make their flight arrangements with the agent staffing the desk, and a few who needed help with flight arrangements and a voucher.
 
One line was an incredibly inefficient way to manage and address the needs of the passengers. One woman with a disabled child in a wheelchair was forced to leave because of the wait. Had there been a line exclusively for those who only needed hotel vouchers, the process would have moved along a lot smoother.
 
When it was our turn, the agent took a call from a colleague before helping us. It was a conversation about which hotel they were handing out vouchers for.
 
""We are only sending people to the Quality Inn, not the Renaissance,"" said the gate agent on our end. This bit of information is important because of what we experienced upon our arrival at the Quality Inn.
 
As it was, we left the gate with our Quality Inn hotel voucher in-hand at about 11:30 p.m., more than an hour after the cancellation was announced and vouchers were offered. By this time our children were incredibly tired, hungry and irritable. Needless to say, my wife and I were, too.
 
The hotel shuttle arrived to pick us up at about midnight. The ensuing ride was horrible and could have cost us our lives. The shuttle driver actually fell asleep at a stop sign. He was literally asleep at the wheel. When he was awake he was swerving terribly into oncoming traffic.
 
By the grace of God, we arrived at the hotel at about 12:15 a.m. We were greeted with a line of angry and tired US Airways customers that extended out the front door of the hotel. An hour and 15 minutes later, we were finally in our room, only to have to wake up five hours later to prepare our children and ourselves for our newly scheduled flight home.
 
As I tried to sleep that night in the Quality Inn, I remembered the comment the gate agent issuing the hotel voucher made to his colleague on the other end of the phone: ""We are only sending people to the Quality Inn, not the Renaissance.""
 
Is it any surprise one motel would be overwhelmed at midnight when a plane-full of customers arrives looking for a place to stay? Perhaps using the Renaissance wouldn't have been such a bad idea.
 
Lastly, to put a capper on this horrible experience, on the flight home as the flight attendants were making their way up the aisle to serve drinks, my wife was asked if she'd like anything. She declined at first, but on second thought decided to enjoy a glass of wine.
 
The flight attendant rolled his eyes at her request. A fitting response, I suppose, given the totality of the experience.
 
We were supposed to arrive home at 9:58 p.m. Wednesday, July 23. Instead, we arrived in Phoenix at about 2:15 p.m., Thursday, July 24. I was forced to miss a day of work. My wife was forced to miss a day of work. All three of our children had to cancel previous obligations.
 
We are incredibly disturbed by the way with which US Airways handled this situation - from beginning to end. It's an experience that was not simply inconvenient, but thanks to your association with the Quality Inn and its shuttle driver, one that could have caused injury or even death. No response after nearly two months!",2,cLK54cehHEgD4AYNyMptTQ

The location looks like a small place from the parking lot since there's not much retail frontage. Inside it fits a fair number of people and can accommodate big groups due to the casual tables and chairs. First off, it's very warm and smoky from the kitchen being an open concept beside the dinning area and the lava stones blasting smoke from most tables. I was sweating and smelled like bbq meat when I left.  I don't think there is any air conditioning, just circulating fans.  Don't wear your Sunday best to come eat here. 

Service was good. They were attentive, explained things well and made us feel welcome.  The food came quick and hot. I was a little disappointed they did not have the non alcoholic drinks in stock that are advertised in the menu, nor was there a chef special dessert as offered on the menu.

We tried a lot of food and it was all good. We were all sharing, since each meal looked so good. The calamari had a wonderful corn breading and came with tasty sauces to dip into. The paella was quite spicy but was so flavourful with sausage, mussels and rice. The sirloin steak on the hot lava stone was great to share as we could cut up the streak and cook the pieces to each persons desired wellness. The steak was delicious and came with salad and spiced fries. The side rib (one big single one) was so tender and fell off the bone. Their bbq sauce is bold and zippy, and there was a second sauce that was extra spicy (I preferred the milder one). The lamb shank also fell off the bone and was a good size piece including marrow in the bone, it was served with the same bbq sauce as the rib. The veggies were well cooked and the mash was smooth and creamy.  The portion sizes are plentiful, we all had a little left over to take home.  It was a meat/carb heavy meal but I like that they came with salads or vegetables to help balance it out a little.  The tiramisu and chocolate moose were also very nice and big portions that could be shared.  Over all a really good meal. 

Next time I want to try the wings appetizer, or maybe the jerk, or the  fillet steak (8 oz).  It all looks so good.",1,9YAcyOPntf2HJszcWgkLow

They also don't have steamed towelettes for cleaning your hands after the crab which is a bit bizarre.
All in all I'd definitely recommend checking out the restaurant. Probably more so for drinks and apps then a full dinner. I'd rather go to John George or sage if I were to dine in.

Too many options to navigate and try and figure out which option costs what.  Also, I ""upgraded"" my combo to poutine but the surcharge they added on was more than the cost difference between fries and poutine itself.

The burger texture was too ""meatloaf"" for my liking... texture resembles sausage too much, too much handling of the meat itself beforehand.

The place was empty but there was loud talking and cooking sounds coming from the kitchen as if the place was packed. I order sesame chicken with lo main and soup. My husband ordered beef and broccoli. 
We waited forever for our food, again we were the only people in there.
The food arrived in take out containers , which was fine however the food was hot , temperature hot, it was inedible . We waited a while and blew on it to cool down, still it was scorching hot. I burnt the roof of my mouth trying to eat a piece of chicken . 
The food was BLAND so my efforts were for nothing . My husbands food was just as bland and tasteless. 
Then they brought us out soup which again was to hot even after blowing on it. 
I'm sure there is a health violation for serving food at 900 degrees . I think the only way to get the food that hot is by a microwave .

They bring out this salad consisting of shredded lettuce with a mildly spicy vinaigrette dressing to start with.  I thought it was fine, something to munch on while your waiting.  Husband didn't like it though.

I ordered the orange beef and husband had the teriyaki chicken.  The orange beef that I had here was one of the best I've ever had.  Its crispy like a good orange beef should be and the sauce was tangy and not spicy at all, even though the menu indicated that it was.  I was hoping it wasn't spicy and was so glad that it wasn't.
The teriyaki chicken was like any other that you can find at any asian place.  It was still very good but nothing out of the ordinary.

We had a bad luck of the draw and our order ended up being behind a large party that was there first so service was a little slow.  My husband had to leave early and had me pack up his leftovers to take home because he was running out of time due to the slow service.  I don't know if I can recommend this place with a limited lunch time for work.  If you're just leaving the theatre and have some time for a meal, definitely stop by here and check it out.

I believe Pinnacle Nissan systematically charges customers for unwanted, undisclosed, and undelivered items, burying them within undecipherable documents or not listing them at all.

In a high-pressure, late-night, used-vehicle sale, Pinnacle Nissan charged me for four such items, totaling $1,614. After many months and letters, Pinnacle Nissan offered to refund me in full for its fraudulent charges in exchange for a non-disclosure agreement. To me, that is an admission of guilt--and a demand to buy my silence so that these fraudulent charges can continue with other customers. I declined to sign in order to preserve my right to publicize this underhanded business practice.

In my case, the items were:

* $325 for ""Door edge guards""  - not installed
* $595 for ""Window tinting""  - CARFAX shows was done for car's first owner
* $399 for ""Zaktek""  - appears to be obligatory (boldly pre-printed on contract)
* $295 for ""Nitrogen kit"" - not mentioned or explained.
 $1614 total 

Except for a bold line item for Zaktek, none of these items appeared on the contract. I found them later in tiny print called ""dealer added accessories"" only on an early rough estimate of car payments which I was told to ignore.

After I filed a complaint with the Attorney General, Pinnacle Nissan offered to refund the full $1,614 -- but required that I sign an NDA. I refused but offered to sign a release for payment in full.

Pinnacle Nissan owes me $1,614; the company must pay without requiring anything from me. If I want to warn potential customers based upon my experience, I preserve that right and will not ""sell"" it for $1,614.

Been here countless times over the years, but it is pretty much the same (if it hasn't gotten worse).

Parking is a nightmare, as there are literally no spots at any time, and it seems everyone is fighting over the spots that are available, making driving conditions terrifying.

Once you get inside, there is essentially a maze of stores, and you can never seem to find anything more than once. You kind of just stumble across a store and go in. A lot of the stores repeat, as there are many stores under one owner, and they all have similar or identical stock. However, prices are usually dramatically cheaper and you can haggle from time to time, depending on the store. Some of the smaller food vendors upstairs are quite good though. Some of the best curry beef balls can be found here!

Overall, this is one of the malls that I hate going to, but is the go-to place to get certain things.

We were hoping to experience a meal with items and flavors we couldn't get back home (the US) and this place seemed like a good choice and was close to where we were staying. I really liked the way they had the local purveyors they used in a kind of image map up on one wall.

We dined early (5pm-ish) on a Friday night and when we arrived I think were the first ones there. Despite that we had a wonderful waiter who joked with us and remained very attentive even as other customers began to arrive. My wife had the lamb sirloin from Quebec which she said was really good and ate every last bite of. It was kind of a rainy day and I was chilly so I went a bowl of the soup d'jour (potato and leek) and their caesar salad with cured local meats. The soup was fantastic, clean mild flavors and I wipe every drop of it from the bowl with the cornmeal topped rolls the waiter brought. The caesar salad was pretty good. It featured a very thick (think room temp butter) on the bottom of the plate then meat, cheese, croutons, and romaine on top so that I had to toss it around to coat the leaves. The main reason I ordered the caesar (other than I love caesar salad) was that it said the croutons were browned with herring oil and I was hoping perhaps a salt-y, brine-y maritime flavor might come through though sadly it did not. None of the flavors of either dish I had were all that powerful, just clean, and better seasoned that many other dishes I ate while on my trip to Montreal. 

My wife had two glasses of a local white wine whose name I can't recall (or believe I had ever heard of) but I believe was the Domaine de l'Orpailleur, Qc Seyval et Vidal.

The Taro Snow Cream I got was light, sorta icy, slightly creamy, but not as dense as ice cream but still full of flavor. The only small qualm I have about it is it reminds me of imitation ice cream and I'm wondering does it have any artificial flavoring? Aside from that I still enjoyed my dessert.   It's more 3.5 rounded up to a 4 cause I'm a fan of the flavors and toppings they carry here. 

What I Really Like About Kuma Snow Cream:

The snow cream stays colder longer. It didn't melt as fast as my frozen yogurt or ice cream usually does.
 
The exotic flavors they offer. Like Taro snow cream. Now all they need is Black Sesame!
 
Toppings hardly available at your typical froyo joint like Custard, Red Bean, Lychee, and Condensed Milk are provided here..... and I repeat now all they need is Black Sesame.

Reasonably priced. I got the ""Create Your Own"" Ninja sized 20oz  piled with three toppings and choice of sauce drizzled on top for $5.50. Now if I was at the yogurt place the same thing weight wise would've cost $2 more. So you get a pretty good value here! 

I like the cutesy names for the combinations they had.  ""Bruce Tea"" for the green tea chef inspired  snow cream creation. It sets the overall tone of the place as fun, light hearted, and family friendly. 

Where is Kuma Snow Cream:

Chinatown/Spring Mountain/Valley View vicinity your visual cue is the Starbucks. Parking is hit or miss depending on time of day you go.
 
The interior and service counter is small but the place is spacious enough to handle a large crowd. Seating area is limited to 3 (or was it four?) tables and some bar stools lined up along the wall.

The employees were friendly and all smiles and eager to help. Place your order and if you are dining in they will call your name when your order is ready.

Okay that's 1 visit down for me. 8 more to go till I get my free Sumo sized one from the punch card. Hopefully it will be a Sumo size cup of Black Sesame (hint hint)",15,2EuPAGalYnP7eSxPgFCNDg

As mentioned in a few other reviews, the Gorilla Wings live up to their name! They're huge in size and in flavor.  The Buffalo Shrimp appetizer is freakin' phenomenal as well! You can get any of their sauces on the shrimp, so you can try something different each time.  Their fries are awesome, crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside.

There are only 3 items on the menu (the cheesecake ($12), the honey madeleine cupcake ($2.50) and the cheesecake biscotti ($4.80)). The cheesecake was delicious, fluffy and light. It wasn't too sweet and the texture was perfect. The honey madeleine was only good when it was fresh out of the oven. After a few hours it was really dry and hardened up. The cheesecake biscotti were really good as well.

I've heard that this fun, little taco joint is owned by the same owner as Firefly (located a hop, skip and a jump down Paradise), one of our absolute favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. Why would we expect any less quality and amazing-ness from Imperial? This place absolutely exceeded our expectations.

The tacos were very thoughtfully crafted with some lovely, complementary ingredients. We tried a wide variety of their signature tacos and I don't see any reason to stray into the other entree options. The cochinita pibil taco was the only land creature I ate that day and it had intensely good flavor; I especially loved the habanero marinated onions. The grilled fish taco didn't blow me away, but was definitely solid. I loved the fried fish taco, but felt the shrimp taco was probably the winner of the day. Family said the puerco verde was a winner, as was the guacamole appetizer we had to start with.

Their tap selection was great and we were able to buy some IPAs for the table. However, I always forget how expensive Vegas is (we aren't residents) and couldn't believe paying $8-10 for a pint of craft beer. Fortunately, we came during happy hour and were able to quench our thirst with some $3 Negra Modelo on draft.

Finally, we had to get dessert. Their version of choco tacos and churros were awesome and expertly crafted, but the gold medal goes to the churros with their chocolate y whipped cream dips.

I got the Malfalde ai Funghi as a main, which was pretty good. The pasta is not too rich despite it's cream sauce, and the flavor of the different mushrooms really came through. Only disappointment was that it was undersalted.

Overall, the food was pretty good, but it's hard to enjoy a meal when the service is really lacking. I hope this was just a one-off thing.",2,8cJcFE1yKrc8GjusK9kifw

My friends and I all have season passes so there's very little we haven't done. It's great for families, groups of friends, team building events, etc. I'm just gonna start from the beginning. You walk up to the front and you're greeted by one of the friendliest guys I've ever met. He's always asking how you're doing, what you're planning, always followed by the most sincere ""I hope you guys really enjoy your time here today"" (or something along those lines). Everybody who works there has the same personality- always looking for ways to make your day better. We usually start off with the zip line. It's just a good way to wake up. Plus you feel kinda like you're flying. My favorite part is the rafting, of course. Raft guides can accommodate all groups, from families with young children to wild, crazy 20 and 30-somethings. You just tell them what kind of ride you want and they'll give it to you. If you want a safe ride, they can do that. If you want to be guaranteed to fall out, they can do that too. Request ""rafting roulette"" for a great time! well, as long as you don't have kids with you. You're pretty much guaranteed a rough ride and someone will probably fall out but it is SOOOO much fun you cant help but laugh when it's over. All of the ropes courses are fun and a good challenge. The flatwater kayaking and paddleboarding are both great ways to explore the Catawba river. If you want to, you can park you kayak or paddleboard and just lay out on one of the beaches, or just float along the river. It's very relaxing! And the best part? The end of the day. There's a great selection of beer (including beers from local breweries) at The Rivers Edge Bar and Grill and after a long day of playing in the water and burning tons of calories, a cool refreshing beer is perfect.

The location is pretty great, being adjacent to the Forum and some of the other major hotels.  However, I felt like everything was more expensive than it needed to be.  It made me feel like I needed to be a little tighter with my money when it came to gambling.

Drinks are about $10 a piece or more, which is pretty on par with everywhere else in Vegas.  I don't think you can get a meal for under $35-40 a person.  It just all adds up pretty fast.  You can't even get a decent deal on rooms any more; for what you get - a pretty standard room and very little atmosphere - they are a little on the spendy side.

Also, we asked for a non-smoking room and unfortunately, the room absolutely reeked of smoke.  We called the front desk and housekeeping attempted to take care of it, but I think it was in the bathroom fan.  As soon as we turned the fan back on the smell came right back.",1,KCg3IFE8LooHWuNE4tHexA

At some point I'll give it one more try with hopes that last Saturday was an ""off-night,"" but it won't be anytime soon.  I'm sure many of you die-hard Noca lovers are fuming right now, but this was genuinely a 3.5 star experience.

Our server was polite but overly rushed all night, which eventually became uncomfortable.  I began with a ""JR's Ripper 12"" cocktail (Citron Vodka, Pama Liqueur, Fresh Squeezed Grapefruit, Jalapeño Essence).  It took 15-20 minutes to receive the first drink, which is just silly, but it was a spectacular concoction.  I highly recommend the Ripper, it was refreshing and the essence of jalapeno did not make it spicy, just added a very unique background flavor.

A significantly long amount of time passed yet again to take our dinner order, but luckily we were enjoying each other's company enough to not worry too much (yet).  

I started with the Crudo Salmon, which was truly exceptional.  I have never had better quality salmon, and the preserved lemon & pine nut accompaniment were a perfect pairing. 

For my next course, I tried the Chitarra Pasta with Prawns.  

Me: ""Could you please recommend a wine for the Prawn Chitarra?""
Rushed Server: ""Red or White?""
Me: ""Hmm, I think white would be nice with the Prawns...""
Rushed Server: ""Pinot Noir.  I'll bring you one.""

While I highly doubt she didn't know Pinot Noir was a red, I was annoyed that she didn't listen to me, didn't make eye contact, and didn't recommend a particular brand, just said ""I'll bring you one"" and ran off.  It was a very good Pinot Noir though (of course it was- she brought me the most expensive by the glass.)
My final course was the pork chop.  It was a huge, beautiful cut of meat, with the fatty edges just starting to crisp.  However it was cooked medium-rare, which I am aware is the proper, foodie-way to eat pork, but I do think it should have been mentioned to me upon ordering.  I am ok with medium to medium-well, but rare to medium-rare is just too much for me.  That little piggy was still slightly breathing.
It was seared in foie gras and paired with a Dijon spaetzel which sounds simply divine, right?  But, there was too much going on- too much salt, too much seasoning, just too heavy in general.  The saltiness was borderline overpowering.

The lag between courses was awkward- entrees took too long and the supplements came much too fast.  Speaking of the supplements, they were so-so.  One was a diced beet salad of sorts, but because the ""supplement server"" was also so incredibly rushed he barely had time to mumble the full description.  I don't think he bothered to even attempt at describing the second supplement.

While everyone (the waiter, his assistant and the sommalier) were very nice, none of them were in sync with each other.  We received our first wine pairing a good 15 min before the appetizer (a shared antipasto plate), so we didn't really pair them because the drink was finished.  The courses were then spaced far apart and the wine and food were not timed well.  You have a choice for pasta, entree and dessert, but they do not customize the wine to your choice of food and just serve the same to the table (for example, I had salmon and my fiance had steak and we were served the same wine.  It seems that they could have put in a little more effort.) The summary is that we went in at 7 and didn't finish until 9:45 and it cost around $500.

Carpet, insulation, something is necessary to make this a functional meeting place.  Right now, it is just bare walls, cement floors, and exposed ceilings.  Looks nice, in a minimalist sort of way, but it's awful for sound purposes.  Since all they do is meetings (I can't imagine someone having a wedding here), you think they'd have figured this out sooner but apparently not.

Jason said he could get us a bus by 10pm but this was not practical and he wouldn't even discuss any kind of discount.  The point of the bus was to go down town and have drinks.  Now we're all downtown in several cars.  What were we going to do when the bus arrived?  Leave are cars?  We told him that we just wanted our money back.  He never took accountability or apologized for his mistake.  He continued to blame the company he contracted.  He then had the nerve to tell me that we should always have a backup plan.  We DID have a backup plan and had to use it because of the incompetence of this company.  I will never use them again.",2,BxQeF3wRKrPYpSkTkNUvFg

As parents with young kids we know that there is only a small window that you can really stop by a restaurant with large strollers in tow and not bother the other patrons. Fortunately when we arrived around 3:30 on a Sunday there was space for us. 

The menu is nice and compact with photos and descriptions of the variety of desserts/beverages they serve. My friends ordered coffee's, which I imagine was nothing too special as this is not their specialty. After browsing the menu, we decided on the mango, black sesame and coffee bingsu's in cup size. The servings are quite large even for the smallest size! Our friends wife actually told her husband that he ordered the wrong one for her as she wanted ""the smallest"" one.  The staff made the bingsu relatively quickly after we placed our orders, providing a cute little pager that they rang once everything was ready. Presentation was adorable as the bingsu was perfectly layered and swirled just as the pictures from previous reviewers had shown. The mango bingsu had large chunks of mango along with pieces of cheesecake that perfectly complimented the flavour. The black sesame had swirls of black sesame layered in between the snow, along with some mochi and red bean on the top to add more dimension to the flavour. The coffee bingsu had a wonderful bitter tone through the espresso syrup, it also had some cereal bits which added a nice texture to each bite. The milk flavoured snow is quite fluffy and nice, however the dessert did end up being a bit too sweet for my taste. It seemed like there may have been condensed milk or some sort of added sweetener in between the layers of snow that just made some bites cloyingly sweet. Overall, I'm very happy with my visit to the cups, and will definitely visit again!",0,Q8sn6JH5NX4DyT7ekWQeMg

If you furniture or other household goods call Habitat for Humanity or Opportunity Village who will also pick up from your home. Unfortunately for me, neither had appointments on the day I was available.

That being said I saw online that they can pick up the larger items you want to donate. Great! I fill out the form to schedule a pickup and am contacted via email asking me to call and schedule an appointment. That's just my own personal pet peeve....a business that has email but insists you call. I ignored and proceded to schedule my pick up via email. I was given a date for my appointment but they will not give a time or even a window.

The day of, around 10am I call to see if they could at least give me a window of time when to expect the driver. A girl who before I've even said anything is annoyed that someone dare interrupt her day and for sure sounds like she hates her job picks up. I Gove her my information and ask if there is a time frame for which I can expect someone to stop by. She very curtly tells me I'm #8 on the list and that's all she will say. Me being me I push for more and she finally informs pick ups are made between 8am and 430pm. (remember that next time you complain about the cable/utility companies and their broad windows haha)

So I continue waiting and finally at 208pm I get a call from the driver saying he's on his way. Perfect! Then 45 minutes passes and still I'm waiting. I call the driver and ask how much longer and he says something I can't hear. I advise his voice is hard to hear and he hangs up on me. I call the donation center back trying to get an ETA and advising of what just happened and don't really get any new information. Another 20 minutes or so the donation center calls and tells me the driver was ""confused"" but I'm next on the list. It's 330pm at this point. An entire day wasted.

Shortly after I get a call again from the driver telling me he's on his way. I ask how long and he says he doesn't know, he just passed The M. So you work and live in Vegas but don't know the drive time from The M to the southwest side of town? More importantly you're a delivery driver who has a set schedule of appointments and you haven't planned your routes via GPS or Google Maps?? Another 40 minutes pass and he finally arrives. I show him what needs to be taken and that's when they advise they don't move items from second floor locations nor do they accept televisions. At no point was I given these stipulations. I had help here the day before who could have moved the items to the first floor.


Overall I think at this point Goodwill might be too large of a corporation (yes, technically non profit org) to appreciate that people are willing to support and donate to their organization. And that a little customer service/politeness/GOOD WILL goes a long way. Definitely take the time to research and donate to  other organizations!",4,R99ylbRDzQ5wDB3ZAEN2Xw

I will search far and wide (though, I'm not sure that's the actual expression) for a great burger. I've heard many a tale of the great Village Bar burger, that uses the power of steam to cook their burgers. But it is a mere dive bar, surely you don't mean that a cash only location such as this has mastered the art of frying a burger. Aye! I have tasted its divine glory! Now, a burger that can make me feel like I need to write in the style of a medieval knight on an epic quest must mean it's a good eat (I hate the medieval theme so much - it just happened, I'm sorry).

Back to the burger. I don't know quite how to describe the 'moistness' of the actual patty - it wasn't that it was 'juicy' because often juicy means messy. No, this was something else, burgers can easily get dry if you cook it too long, this patty was far from that, in fact it was quite the opposite. Top it with cheese and place the pickles on the side (thank you - didn't realize I needed to ask without pickles, glad to see they weren't served on my burger) and I think I just enjoyed what everyone has been raving about.

The Village Bar - you a quite a vintage little place aren't you? I'm not particularly fond of dive bars, but they had so much classic memorabilia displayed in the table that made for a nice little search and discover during my wait for food. They also have plenty of tvs (even some flat screens) to watch the game of your choosing. I must say, I was annoyed that they don't take cards, though I'm sure my review won't be changing that anytime soon - at least they have an ATM accessible inside the bar.

There is just something about that burger that will have me stopping in again and bringing friends as they stop in town for a visit. For that reason, and that reason alone - The Village Bar has earned all five of my stars that I have to give.",3,1Dj1VmFzA-t9fT8d4ExJAA

And being Vegas locals why not go to the new one so that we can shop at the outlets right after. Lets start off by saying I'm 9 months pregnant so waiting for food for too long is not my best friend. We came in and it took a second to be greeted by the host because she found whatever she was doing to be more important. After she was done she did greet us and we waited to be seated. Our host came and showed us to our seat and said our waiter would be with us shortly. So to kill time we started talking until we noticed it had been 5 min already and no one has acknowledged us yet , but we saw plenty servers walking by. My patience started wearing thin as an additional 10 minz had went by and weren't offered so much as a hello, a drink, NOTHING. so I finally asked a girl if I can speak with the manager and instead of going to get he or she, she replied ""oh I'm your server give me a minute they seated three of y'all at once"". First that's very unprofessional, second don't think that because we're both African american that I'll just be ok with that and let you talk to me the way you feel comfortable, and third if you were so busy its not that hard to COMMUNICATE that with your guests. So of course I took my business elsewhere so thanks a lot for wasting my time that I can never get back and ruining my birthday and I will be sure to yelp you folks as well.

My husband and I have been going to this office for over 2 years now and have never been able to see the great and wonderful dr Jordan. Instead we've always been scheduled to see the PA Kristen Sharma, who is now no longer there. 
If you plan on becoming a patient of dr Jordan you should understand that you will most likely never actually see her but will see whoever is her PA at the moment. You willl also need to be able to understand that while your health and well being isn't important enough for her to actually ever even speak to you or look at your chart, it is important enough to her that you will need to be seen at a minimum of every 6 months for your maintenance scripts to be refilled. I can no longer be held hostage by her money first policy. My husband has been on blood pressure meds for over 20 years now and his life is at risk if he goes without them for even one dosage. Never before has he been required by any doctor to be seen more then once yearly to have his medications refilled. But that is not the case with this doctor. Dr. Jordan sees an opportunity to hold people hostage to get their life saving medications. If you want them you need to come in and pay an office visit to get the scripts. 
I was actually told by the staff member that ""it's only a quick 15 minute appointment to get your scripts refilled"". Wow, a quick 15 minute appointment, that's it huh?! Take a couple hours off of work, pay $180 at the front desk, let the nurse weigh you, take your temperature and blood pressure, let the PA look in your ears and nose with the scope and then when they're all done pretending that your health and well being is their utmost priority they'll get on their laptop and submit new scripts to the pharmacy for you. ( Don't get me started on the aggravation of adding new scripts for the same meds to your pharmacy profile every 6 months instead of just approving the refills from the previous ones). Now do you really think they learned anything more about you that would prevent them from refilling your blood pressure or antidepressants? No, of course not! All they did was create an invoice and send you out the door a couple hundred bucks poorer. Not to mention now you need your hurry back to work and stay a couple hours longer to make up for the time lost for that crap show! 
The cardiologist who is the expert on cardiovascular health only needs to see my husband once a year to evaluate his health and prescribe his meds. My husband will only go to him from now on for his blood pressure meds. We will find another general practitioner for our other needs. 
No more hostage payoffs to doc Cynthia for our medications. That's quite a racket she's got going in there! If I could give a negative 5 stars for this review I surely would!",1,Ou5iyOCD7et4bnlWdqcncQ

I really don't have a lot to elaborate on this place... they've really got to step up their food selection! Had I known that the flavor would be bland across the board I wouldve just stuck with crab legs and dessert... those were the only things that I was actually excited about. Everything else could have been served at a Golden Corral and I wouldn't have known the difference. Bland...and/or dry... and/or folks trying to be clever with cooking foods that are better left keeping it simple. 
The turkey wasn't too horrible... but it wasn't good enough that I felt the need to try the other meats they had to offer..which wasn't much if I recall correctly. The mashed potatoes were bland. I had been craving pots mashed, too... so that really got me down. They had some fancy macaroni that just didn't do it for me. Perhaps I'm too country for Aria's buffet... but come on... what's a buffet without good ol' macaroni and cheese?!

I have been coming to this Hooters for years now. There hasn't been a time where I have had a bad experience here. The food has always been on point, customer service was not bad, and really nothing to complain about. I've always ordered the medium/hot wings along with the curly fries with cheese and a side salad. I've brought friends with me on several occasions, and they never had anything negative to say.

It's been a month or so that I've been here and decided to try the take out. Same order same expectations. Now I know every business will have their bad days but this is the first time here that has probably made me decide I will not return.
I open the to go boxes and let's just say I was surprised. The fries looked extremely dull and I picked one up to try it; cold. Cold, dull fries that had an old taste to them. Not like they were sitting around but old as if they were out for a long time. Super soggy and just absolutely terrible. The wings were undercooked and the hot sauce that I usually get tasted bland and cold. It was as if they just battered them up with canned sauce. No flavor, and not the amazing wings I usually get there. I am thinking is this really the place I talk so good about?
I read the negative reviews thinking this is not true. I now believe the ""hype"" regarding the issues they are having here. It's amazing how down under it has gotten since I've last been here. It's not like the food was waiting for a long time, I got there before it was even ready.

Honestly, I am extremely disappointed. The manager was not much help and that just comes to show how down under this business is heading to. I don't know what else to say, 30$ that has gone to waste. Ate a few of the fries and maybe half of a wing that was disgusting.

_ZfjpSEO5ntk-1hbnwCR4g,1,2011-10-19 06:14:13,1,giguUtV6K5PLIvMlIktruA,3,"Quick summary: If you want a very pretty room that is not very close to the strip - Palms Place is awesome. If you're hoping for more than that - you know - knowledgeable staff, pools, proximity to the strip, etc. Palms is not so awesome.

Longer version: The rooms are really nice. Ours (a studio) had some minor problems - namely, various parts of the room were damaged/broken (two lights in the bathroom were out, some strip broken off of some places on the counter in the room, various dings in the stainless steel surfaces, etc). But nothing major. The patio was locked off and somewhat gross looking. The beds were comfy. The room was super pretty. Nice tub. Overall, a great room.

The staff were more of an issue. We were given lots of wrong information about things happening around the area. The one huge plus I'll give the staff is that my lovely companion left some jewelery in our room when we checked out. We called the staff and they were able to track it down for us and return it to us within about an hour of us calling. Awesome. However, a major staff problem was the housekeeping - when we checked in - our room was simply not clean. Don't get me wrong - it had been ""cleaned"". But it had trash on the ground. And some of the seats were incredibly dusty. I mean like you could write ""wash me"" with your fingertip on the seats. That dusty.

The pools were also a major issue. They close early (I think at 6 PM or something like that). Am I the only person in the world that loves going to pools at night? Further, the main pool was closed off for much of our time there for some show that cost $100/person (or was it $50/person? Staff gave conflicting information here). Thus we were stuck in the teeny little pool in Palms Place. There was no seating available (though a nice maintenance guy was able to hook me up when I asked), but there were tons of empty cabanas (that they were chasing people out of) that I suspect they wanted some insane price for. The bartenders at the pool were awful (incompetent and rude). Also, charging $12 for a rum and coke is insane.

Getting to and from the strip is about a $15 taxi ride. There is a shuttle that goes to/from the strip once per day. Literally once. No airport service, of course (that's about $25). There is a ""resort fee"" of $15/day. They're quick to tell you that gets you a $20 drink credit. That credit only works at bars in the casino, and it doesn't go too far (though they are less overpriced than the pool). It also expires the day it is issued for.

Service/staff/location/pools get minus 5 stars.
The actual rooms get 4.5 stars.

I'm not good at math so somehow that's becoming three stars.",3,7jRqME7-krCDvdkR-dadgA
OfITr0B8bZU3vukSQJIrWQ,1,2012-09-19 03:22:05,1,oyoo_2ux5KYiRx01L0Fgkg,3,"So i read all the glowing reviews of this place, and knowing the history of the joint, i was excited to try out the new place. 

As Richard Attenborough would say, they ""spared no expense"" in the remodel. They've transformed a generic Joey's of Chicago into a classy, snappy decor, with a twist on the unisex bathrooms. The patio outside is very welcoming when the weather permits and they did throw in a couple of TVs to catch the game.  They've added the prerequisite in Arcadia, dual garage door that opens the bar onto the patio. Should be a nice touch in a few months. 

We were greeted promptly and found a nice hi-top in the bar area. The wine and beer list is extensive. We were informed of the happy hour specials and decided that would be our focus for this visit. 

We started with their Dulce Camarones---small lightly battered fried shrimp with slice veggie garnish on a bed of lettuce with aioli. This dish was disappointing, the shrimp was small and had a very mild taste. The aioli was the strongest flavor by far, and that was muted. Then we tried the Carne Tacos and the pork tacos. The carne was moist, and delicious, the pork was mediocre. Each order came with three tacos, which were 2-3 bites each. 

We finished off with  Alitas (Grilled Wings) coated with Habanero glaze. These had a pleasant yet mild flavor, but not as spicy as I had hoped

So why the three stars? Well I'd give them 2.5 if I could. Maybe my expectations were too high based upon the previous reviews. We spent 34 dollars including tip, and didn't order any drinks. Meh, I expected and wanted more from my visit.",4,DssV9fskchomqfh7jeYavA

I went to have some watch batteries replaced which I've done there once and other locations several times before.  

When they said they don,t warranty the watch if they break it, if they're valued over $100, I told them I thought that was an odd policy.  I said I didn't really like the policy but I'll accept it and get them replaced anyway.  They then flat out REFUSED to replace the batteries.  I asked them, even though I accept the policy you won't replace them?  And the clerk said no I won't.  You,ll have t take them to a jewelry store.  What's odd as they are not really expensive watches.  

I told them this was a very poor excuse for customer service and he shrugged his shoulders.  

So since batteries are the sole existence for this business I wouldn't waste your time as it's a gamble if they,ll service them. I wouldn't give my business to someone that has such poor customer service.

You can't really expect that kind of food at ANY buffets. For the price you pay and the food you get, it's worth the money. 

The lines here are freaking ridiculous. I happened to stop by here once on a weeknight after shopping with my family at around 8:30PM. There wasn't much of a line, so we were able to try this place out.

After looking over the menu I decided to order a beer and a roll of sushi (let me clarify) ONE roll of sushi, and my friend decided to get some ramen. After about 10 mins go by, they bring out the ramen but no sushi. I wasn't in a huge rush so no worries - I understand it can get busy in the kitchen. Five mins go by, then ten, then 15, and finally 20. By this time my friend had completely finished his meal, I had finished my beer, and the hour of parking I paid for was 10 mins to expiring. 

Let me also add, halfway through my friend eating, they decided to ask for ID as they wanted to open up the partition between the patio and restaurant. He's only 20 but this issue shouldn't arise halfway through a paying customers meal.

My server, Sage, had came to our table several times during this wait amazed I still didn't have my food and actually checked back to the kitchen 2-3 times for me before I finally received it (she was great). But I have never in my life had to wait 30 mins for a roll of sushi. 

Upon receiving my food, the manager decides to come over to explain how ramen takes two mins to make while sushi somehow takes 30 mins (because it's an ""entree"" and somehow ramen isn't?) - all he could say was ""I understand, BUT..."". All he needed to say was, ""I apologize is there anything I can do to make it better?"" - that would have made the difference between me writing this yelp review or not.

He offered me free edamame but seeing as I had just gotten my ""entree"" and had finished my beer, I countered the offer by asking if they could refill my glass so I had something to enjoy my meal with; he begrudgingly accepted. However, when I got the bill I was charged $8 for a draft beer - even if I had gone to a club up the street I would have paid max $5.50 to $6 for the same product accompanied by better service, and better management. I paid the bill, tipped the waitress and got out of there before anything else could go wrong. All in all, this place is a JOKE.

We knew that when we purchased our first home it had to have a pool. Unfortunately, the house we got didn't have a pool, but it did have a backyard that we can build a pool in! So we went on the hunt to find a reputable contractor to work with. 

When we were searching for a contractor to work with, it was so stressful. We were on a specific budget and had limited space to work with, but we really wanted a pool. We met with and quoted our project with 5 different pool building companies. We were shocked at the huge variation in prices, complicated options, requirements, and suggestions. Also, some of the people were a pain in the butt to work with! We felt like we were being given a huge runaround and the price was going to constantly be an influx on all projects. 

And then we met Princess - she was a straight shooter. She looked at our budget and told us exactly what we could get for that.  And guess what, we got an amazing pool!  It's not super fancy but it's way more than we were told we could get by all those other companies.  Working with Greencare was a lot of fun too from the start! These people are going to be in your homes almost every day during the entire project. You want to make sure these are people who have your best interest in mind. It was crucial for us to also have a great relationship as well! It's a relationship and partnership that you can't just give to anyone especially with the amount of time and money you're spending! Within the first meeting we could tell working with Greencare would be our best bet to finally get the backyard we wanted! 

It has been a fantastic experience from beginning to end! We had so much fun working with Princess, our pool designer, on the project. She worked with our budget and small backyard to give us what we wanted and so much more. The entire crew was extremely polite and easy to work with. Even when there were a few hiccups, which is always to be expected with any construction project, the crew always worked quickly to get it fixed. 

During the pool building process, Gary and his team did an exceptional job in our backyard and pool! Not only is Gary excellent at what he does in building pools, but he also makes the process seamless. As the pool construction coordinator, his approach to problem-solving was refreshing. His team was always professional and on time. You could tell they were committed to the quality of work they were providing. It was crucial they get the job done RIGHT the first time. They also kept us in the loop the entire process as well. Princess and Gary were helpful in navigating us through the entire process. Each step was handled with care and precision to ensure the end result was exactly what we wanted. In the end, the Greencare team delivered exactly what they promised and within the timeline and budget.

These come with 6 pieces (3 egg rolls cut in half), and coupled with a jalapeno ranch type dip and a side of salsa, all over shredded lettuce. 

For dinner I ordered the Prime Rib french dip sandwich. The sandwich is delicious. It comes topped with horseradish sauce, a side of au jus, and a side order. I recommend the mashed potatoes, I ordered the fresh cut french fries, though these need work. They do not taste like fresh cut fries, but like greasy lower tier french fries.

I viewed it as a great workout and break from my more typical training, involving mostly lifting a lot of heavy shit (i.e. weights) and some running. While I enjoyed it, nothing really resonated with me at the time. Spending the last year or so doing some pretty intense self reflection and major work on staying 'present' when faced with...well, life I guess, I decided it was time to bring yoga back into my world. 

Enter Urban Yoga. 

The location is perfect, (within walking distance from my building) the space is gorgeous and has a very calming feel to it. The staff seem to be genuine and all very helpful, and each class I've attended has felt incredibly comfortable, even for a fairly reserved person such as myself.  
The only time I felt uncomfortable was last night when I attended my first Ashtanga class. Actually, uncomfortable is an understatement. 

Prior to this I had only experienced the Urban Flow class and Core Vinyasa Flow. I immediately thought I was in over my head with all the Sanskrit Asana call outs, all with little to no explanation and I had a little bit of a panic attack moment. I'm dead serious when I say that I was just about to freak out, grab my mat and get the hell out of there when I accepted that my fear and feelings of inferiority were just that, mine. No one was laughing at the doofus in the corner all doe eyed and scared shitless. I took a deep breath (or many) and kept up the best I could. I'm glad I stayed because I left feeling great psychically and mentally and like I had taken a huge step to overcome an issue that has haunted me probably since birth, or at least chip away at a part of it. 

Studio Yoga is not cheap folks...anywhere, including Urban Yoga But the benefits I have personally received from continuing to make the effort to get up and go far outweigh the cost. Six months ago I would have walked right out of there and never come back out of feeling foolish and being embarrassed. Six months ago I would have been embarrassed to admit that I felt foolish and embarrassed. (sounds funny, but trust me, being that self aware is pure hell) Not yesterday. Not tomorrow either.

It's apparently impossible to get 2 pork meatballs and 2 beef meatballs.  This is unfortunate because it doesn't let me try a wider variety of your food and also because it's unbelievably easy to accommodate.  I should be able to get 4 different kinds of meatballs if I want.  Seriously?

I didn't eat in the restaurant but it seemed to be having the usual identity crisis that most Pittsburgh restaurants and bars have.  Half upscale, half sports bar.  Nice decor, ESPN on a TV.  Make a choice and stick with it.

My comparisons were easy to make because there's a meatball only restaurant in my town (24th & Meatballs) that does a much better job and has been doing it for longer (i.e. I'm sure this place is probably a rip off).

I had already been there for 5 plus hours and was super tired and hungry but who would have thought the price would have changed so drastically? So once I went into finance to sign, I thought it was so weird that he did not go line by line over the charges like new car price, trade value, negative equity you have to carry, rebates, how many years the terms are for, and final payment ( iahve bought about 5 cars in last 10 years and NEVER have they not gone over every line in finance) but I was so tired its 9:30pm by this time so when he knowingly slides the paper work just right to the bottom to sign it kinda triggered me the next day and I said you know what I need to review all my paper work. So I get the papers and OMG yupp sale price of car is $28,881.00 so that is HOW they are ""helping"" me by selling me a $21k car for OVER marked price of $28k .....I am truly at a loss of words, I knew yea I was going to have to carry over some negative money from my trade in but dear lord not $7k more. They think they can get away with murder because Nissan does their own financing/banking. Also not to mention finance guy said yeah you get free ZAKTAX sun protection every 6 months on the car too, but again there was a paper showing I was paying $397.00 for this $5 car paint protection YET again never told to me i was paying for this. I know my bad for being to tired and stupid for not asking to see each line of cost but never in my life did I think a human could be this shady and scamming with a dam smile on their face. I hated car sales people before but now this is at a whole new level of hate, and they have made car buying an even more hated thing to do. My car sales guy was Eddie Ysai, manager Cameron Akins and finance guy I cant remember his name but I have his card, ALL these assholes knew what was going on here and all did it with a smile, they are all liars, schemers, money taking fools....ooooo and I cannot forget that they also ask for your debit card during the app time, to verify you but then take the card to the back, and I could be wrong but I really think these people call the 1-800 number to your bank to check your balance, because then the pressure came with are you SURE you cannot put any money down.

I went in for a pumpkin donut, why? Because it's not even two weeks until Thanksgiving, and who doesn't want a couple pumpkin flavored donuts this time of year? Corporate Dunkin Dounts, that's who, or at least that's what I was told. Was told I'd have to go somewhere else to get pumpkin flavored donuts, not in that many words, but what they told me was that corporate allowed them to purchase just so many of them until they were not available any more for the year.
If this is true ( and if it's not, someone still screwed up to not have pumpkin flavored donuts this time of year) then I think it's a bone headed decision. I mean talk about being out of touch with your customers. Talk about turning away business and sending your custom base to another donut store. Talk about plain stupidity.

Unfortunately the server recommended the lettuce wraps, but I would not order these again. You couldn't pick the wraps up, so it was just like a small salad.

VZOlFKHD6PEQVv9aDs1u_w,0,2014-04-01,0,AVD020pRBn1Ubnrk-A3WPw,1,"Stopped in once to ask about my laptop battery not charging (I had read Dell Diagnostics and support threads, but wanted to take it in first before I got into buying parts). The visit was probably 10 minutes and the guy at the counter literally just turned the computer on to see the ""not charging"" message, turned it off and directed me to Batteries Plus. Needless to say I was a bit surprised, but I thought maybe he was trying to save me some money. 

So off to Batteries Plus I go, where the only battery they had in stock wasn't a complete match and did not work on my system. They offered to order me a replacement battery for $170, but I figured I could get a better deal online. So I ordered a replacement battery and AC adapter just in case. Both come and I try them with no success. My computer won't recognize the new battery. While testing all this I realized that there was a BIOS update I needed, but wouldn't run because my Dell battery didn't have enough charge and the replacement battery wasn't recognized. 

So I went back to Data Doctors with all the parts and explanation of what I had found. I suppose I should have turned around as soon as they couldn't take my credit card info because their router was down (not good for an IT/computer company to have IT issues). For some reason they asked to keep the replacement AC adapter, but not the replacement battery only to call me 2 days later and ask for the battery (never mind that their hours mean I am late to work if I have to stop by). So by Friday afternoon, after having my computer for 5 days, I called to check on it because 5 days seemed like an awful long time to have my laptop. They told me almost word for word what I told them was the problem on Day 1. The diagnosis was that I needed a Dell battery and not a generic replacement. It took them 5 days to tell me that. 

They also told me they had discovered some Trojan viruses on my computer. I was skeptical since I have been shelling out money to McAfee for years. So when I got my computer back I ran a scan, which came back negative, but when looking at the scanning history, I was reminded that McAfee did find 4 viruses 2 YEARS AGO and had quarantined them.

I am glad I got my laptop back when I did and am sorry I didn't ask for a refund because the only thing Data Doctors did for me was prevent me from having a usable laptop for a week. I certainly don't need them to order me a Dell battery, when I can do that myself. I was under the mistaken idea that a computer repair company would have spare parts to test systems so that I could have diagnosed the issue before having to go out an replace parts one by one. I should have called my company's IT department back in Virginia because they would have been more helpful.

I can't speak to other locations, but I will never patronize the Ahwatukee store again. I did ultimately resolve the problem when I found PHX CPU. Since I had pretty much done all my own diagnostics, I realized it was either the DC power jack or motherboard. Thankfully, it was the former and PHX CPU replaced my power jack and my laptop is running perfectly again.",3,kVVwLexO6MwRzaJRP8w_sw

This is one of the older GoodLife clubs but it was renovated several years ago (I can't remember the exact time frame as I was a member of Bally Fitness back then) but I want to say 2004-2005.

The club is located on the second level offices opposite the theatres and the layout is a bit odd as it seems like everything was shoe horned to fit some leftover space.  This location has a swimming pool though many may challenge that definition and call it an oversized bathtub.  It is unique for any gym in the downtown to offer a pool and it uses salt water.

The facility is small and there is minimal equipment so expect to share often working in while you're resting between sets.  You need to pass through an open concept spinning room to get to a weights area and the aerobics room in the far back of the gym.  The older gym had old carpeting and the update has certainly helped.  I use this club when i'm in the area so it's my second most used gym outside of my home club.

The trainers and members seem pretty nice here bit I'm not familiar with any of the instructors in these classes.  Despite it's small size, it has enough equipment to get a short workout in without any major issues.The space is tight between the equipment and some of them are older.

He told me the 18 year old needed a ticket and the two under 12 did not.  I asked about the Groupon for the Happy Half Hour and that is when we were told about the need to redeem the Groupon at the Concierge.  He also told me the next Happy Half Hour car was going to be available at 8:10 PM.  I then proceeded to the Concierge where I exchanged the Groupon and once again explained the situation, four adults and three children.  No comment was made other than have a good time.  

When we got to the area where you board the High Roller we gave them our tickets and were told that the children would have to board a separate car because no one under 21 was allowed on the Happy Half Hour car!   First we had been told of this rule - in Las Vegas??? Give me a break....  So we asked to speak to a manager.  He showed up and was totally indifferent to our situation.   We asked why no one at the ticket counter had told us about the rule?  He didn't know....   We asked about getting a comped drink from the High Roller bar, he said no.  We asked about refunds, he said there was nothing they could do about Groupon because they don't ""get any money from them"".  Again, give me a break.....   This situation could have easily been resolved with a few comped drinks.  The Manager was very rude in his approach to us, offering that we should have ""a nice night"" in a very insincere tone.  The High Roller customer service is terrible and they clearly don't care about their customers.  

The overall experience wasn't all that great anyway, no better than going to the bar at the top of the Stratoshpere.

I had originally purchased the Groupon, however they said that Saturday was the only night they didn't accept Groupons so I ended up just paying for the full service. First of all, I LOVED the decor and concept of the salon! It's decorated beautifully and it feels open, clean and luxurious. There's a bar in the entrance, and sinks and pedicure, manicure and blow dry stations on the other side. 

The person who did my hair was super friendly and I really enjoyed chatting with her. I wish she had asked what I wanted before I started though, because I prefer big curls in my hair. She put manual rollers into my hair to curl it that way, and it ended up coming out a bit flat. Perhaps I should've been a little more assertive in the beginning, however she kept saying ""it looks so good"" and I felt bad saying anything otherwise. My hair did smell amazing afterwards though, and the hairstyle I guess was ok.

I don't necessarily think it's worth the $60 to come here for a blow out, when I feel like I could've done a better job at home. The Groupon is worth it though, since it's half price and you get a free glass of wine! I don't think I'll be back unless there's a really really special occasion, and if then, I'll certainly be more assertive about what I want.",4,JE6ZqyqHRwTfhuDdhhS3bA

If you look, I usually like to only review places I LIKE. So people will go there. Why waste time to help advertise places I do not like. This is an exception.

Here is the gist, my friend had left because she was hung over. She had ordered bread from the cart, prior to leaving. I did not. So she got her food in a box and left, while myself and 4 other friends stayed for the rest of the dinner. While we were enjoying our entrees I was eating HER bread. The bread was wheat bread, and I admit, was delicious. So the waiter (whom french accent sounded super unauthentic) seeing that she left, comes over to clean up and remove her place setting - which is normal. He reaches over and grabs the plate with the bread on it, which was next to me. I tell him ""No no leave the bread, I am eating it"". Now, what is the common sense  thing to do, if you were the waiter?

Think about it... Common sense?!?!

Answer: You put the plate down!!! walk away and let the customer enjoy the bread! 

Right????

You do not even need to say anything, but of course, instead of doing this, he spoke back in condescending tone ""But monsieur, that is the ladies bread"" as if I broke some sort of natural law- Is it really unacceptable for me to eat someone else bread?If the same situation occurs at any other restaurant, I can *almost* guarantee you they will put the plate down and would probably even be glad to do so. 

So he grabs the plate (with my hand on the plate as well!) and said ""I will bring you another bread"". I totally recall thinking... Why is he arguing with me? So he takes off with the plate and this was when I was not too happy. He did come back with bread, but it was NOT the same type!! Obviously, I am not going to make call him out because it is not the same kind of bread but this added to my fury!!!!

Alright, because this happen with bread, you may say ""it's only bread"" Well, lets substitute this situation with say.. soup. Your friend leaves so you are enjoying their clam chowder which was ordered. The waiter comes over to deny you of it, even though you ask to leave it there. He brings you a new bowl of soup, however when it arrives, its some cream of broccoli. 

I know most of you would say something about the soup!

Anyways the food.. I ordered the Kobe Beef. I had six ounces of it, its sold by the ounce. It was not good. The above incident occurred during the main course, so I stopped eating. Left a couple ounces on the plate and did not allow anyone to touch it. 

Another one of my friend saw I was upset and so she said something to the manager (or owner, not sure) and he provided complementary glass of wine to everyone. I made sure nobody drank the wine they gave me. 
I do not need this crap and you do not either, hundred of places in Vegas to have a great dining experience. I walked out upset. 

it maybe a funny story with my friends and I now but at the moment, I was Pissssssed.


Never again!

The building and interior locals very modern and quiet in place with Scottsdale; I really like the look of this place. 

The 3 beers they have are the IPA, Saison & Wesern Lager. The Lager i was not too impressed by; it's maltier then expected, much like a Marzen. The IPA is not very hoppy but flavorful, reminds me of Deschutes Mirror Pond. The Saison is in my opinion their best and is bottled and avaible outside the taproom, so try it out.

We ordered a bunch of appetizers to share and they were all very good.  The seafood pancakes were off the hizzay.

The waiting staff were very friendly - our waitress was patient with me when I attempted to order in Korean :) We over-ordered bottles of soju, so I was pleasantly surprised they took one back.  Some places wouldn't do that, I'm sure. 

And the atmosphere was very clean and tidy.  You gotta love the screen of k-pop videos too.  Great dinner conversation piece :)",1,9UU6zIApmiI3ypXJjeAw-w

Our server was fun loving with a good knowledge of the restaurant's beer selection.  We were greeted as soon as we walked in the door, seated immediately, and our order was taken soon after.

We started with the Alligator appetizer.  As many others have mentioned, this item is not on the menu, but is very popular.  It consists of fried breaded bits of alligator (about the size of popcorn chicken) served with a few French fries in a basket.  It comes with a spicy cocktail sauce to dip.

The server suggested that I order the crawfish etouffee and I was not disappointed.  A generous portion of shelled crawfish are covered with a spicy brown roux sauce with a mountain of moist dirty rice in the middle.  Adding some of the hot sauce from the table made it just the right temperature.

I've since left that job but moved closer to Angel's, so I'm basically a Sunday evening regular at this point.

32 beers on tap, plus about 5 wine selections on tap as well. I'm more a stouts and porters girl, but you never know what you'll find at Angel's! IPAs aplenty, stouts, porters, gose, sours, fruit beers, ales of all kinds, a cider or two, and seasonal beers are all common finds. There's usually 2 on the nitro tap, and a rotating selection of a few Arizona beers. 

I mostly sit at the bar when I stop in, and the bartenders are all quite friendly without being overbearing. Some forget to give you a glass of water unless you ask for one, some give you one automatically.

The place is not a sports bar, they have two TVs playing some manner of sporting events (usually football or baseball) with the sound off and closed-captioning. Music is also usually unobtrusive, thanks to their random Pandora offerings. If you're the type who prefers a rowdy, sports-centric bar, Angel's ain't the place for you. If you want a somewhat lively bar with a nice, large patio, extensive beer selection, and solid food options, this is the place.

Oh, the food. Their menu isn't huge, but it delivers in unique-ness. My favorite thing on the menu is the Central, a fried chicken sandwich with lettuce, tomato, pepperjack cheese, bacon, red onion, jalapeño ranch, and cucumber. The cucumber is what makes it, for me. Their fries are quite tasty, thicker than shoestring fries with a house seasoning that may just be seasoned salt for all I know. Be warned -- their ketchup is made in-house, and it's nowhere near the usual Heinz stuff. In my opinion, it would be more complemented by mozzarella sticks than fries, but if you go in knowing it's not your usual ketchup, you might be pleasantly surprised.

I've also tried their soft pretzels app with beer cheese and beer mustard. Very good, light and fluffy hot pretzels.

I spent around 100 bucks to shoot two clips worth for the M-4 shotgun and M (something) short burst machine gun.  First time I've ever shot a gun from either category.  One thing I learned was I love shotguns.  The short burst wasn't too hard to aim either.  When I was looking through the scope with the crosshairs and red dot in the center, I thought to myself, ""It's like Call of Duty...except I can smell the gunpowder and feel the weight of the gun.""

That said.  I don't give it a 5 stars because I realized I just spent more than $100 for basically 5 to 10 minutes of fun.  *insert sex joke here*  Needless to say, but I'll say it anyway, I don't know if this is a good deal or not.  In California, I fired pistols and revolves and with the rental and 50 rounds, I'll spend maybe $40.  $10 for subsequent boxes of ammo.

They have a large selection of weapons, good teachers, and knowledgeable staff, so I can't really hate.  I mean, if you go to Vegas, you should have a lot of money.  That shouldn't change even if you're not in the strip.  So if you have money, you're not military or former military with a hook-up in exercising your right to bear arms, then this place is a cool spot to check out and try out some guns.  Buying?

Sorry, it's only a sample. All of the hand-knitted items at Americo are ""samples only"". 

O Americo, you tease.

Hmm. I circle the store thinking up another approach. 
As my eyes skim the hundreds of skeins of unique yarn, I suddenly find myself dreaming of the many things I could make with the beautifully, handspun threads. That is, if only I could knit such elaborate things. 

Plan A:
Approaching the service counter and pouting out my lower lip, I whine, ""I really want that bbbbbag. Bbbbbut, all I can knit is an ugly scarf."" With sad little puppy dog eyes, I scan for signs of sympathy. Maybe, just maybe, now they'll sell me that pretty red bag in the window. 

No cigar. The staff won't budge on the bag. But they kindly tell me that I can make the bag, even if all I can make is a scarf. I'm skeptical. They must be mistaken. I tell them the scarf I'm wearing is not said ugly scarf. I admit to them, my ugly scarf actually resembles a ball of yarn and two needles in my closet.

With the purchase of supplies, you can have your pick of pattern and free knitting classes. Skill levels range from basic to advanced and patterns include the vests, sweaters, shawls, hats, mitts, and of course, bags. I learn that pretty red bag is called the ""Miramar Bag"".

Supplies are plentiful, but it's the yarn that catches my attention. The colour range is just my style: earthy, rich, and vibrant. I don't know what it's called in yarn terms, but Americo carries everything from skinny to fat diameters, and hairy, fluffy, silky, chunky textures. I'm not familiar with prices for yarn, but at approximately $15 per skein, I think that's a bit hefty. But I think back to the bag, the bag I would've bought and I reason a few skeins plus free classes is a reasonable trade-off.

Plan B:
I take the business card offered to me for the class schedule and decide on an azure blue yarn.

You will be mine Miramar, yes you will...

As I leave Americo, I daydream of my crafty potential. I can't help but think of the cliché: ""if you teach a man to fish...""",8,mKemb3MpSyUbsVUVSmI5tg

Okay, I must admit that I arrived at Icehouse with high expectation after seeing it aired on Food Network TV Canada few weeks ago while in Ottawa. I have a couple on my list after my Ottawa stay and is trying to clear as much as I could if they are within reach. 

Since Icehouse is within our radar, we decided then to explore the area where Saint Laurent Boulevard would lead us. The street is long and in between, I spotted some of my ""must-eat"" gems and marked the landmark to make a return. 

Turning right into one of the lane, I enter a quaint street away from the crowd from St Laurent and into rue Roy E. I excitedly trying to eyeball for Icehouse while focusing on my GPS assisted google map working in the background. Smart enough, I knew I have arrived! I rolled my eyes to the left and couldn't hide my excitement when I saw the signage with a calf standing atop the grilling at the entrance. 

The day's business has just began, it's 15mins past 4pm. We were their 1st couple on Thursday! We chose our 2-seater and the lady came to us with a glass of tap and asked if we wanna start off with some drinks. Bourbon lemonade's  a winner, leave the ice tea out! The latter is so tad sourish and lifeless for a $4 while I enjoyed the former much even though it cost slightly higher at $9. The lady politely introduced the special for the day and told us the menu is on the chalkboard right above the bar counter. Right away, I admitted that I came here for their fried chicken and she was happy to list me all the sides that came with it. Well, I guess she's thrilled about the media publicity seems to work. We were the only Asian gals in the petite dining room. Crowd floods the room soon. 

Within 15minutes, she returned with a brown parchment paper ripped off from its roll and laid it on our table, along with 2 forks and towelettes. Along with, she brought along 2 condiments that she sing praises: less spicy nectarous mustard sauce and another more fiery one. I opt for the former while my sister went for the latter. I agreed with the lady that the condiments did a good job on the fried chicken for a more flavorful experience.

Seriously, I do not know what makes a good tex-mex fried chicken but if it was going to be something I had at Icehouse, then I will be disappointed. The chicken parts  were decent in size, not too small. But the problem we had lies in its rock-liked crust. I am not sure if that was how it meant to be when u claimed that its a Tex classic? The meat was bland, bare and unseasoned. If that's the reason for the hot/sweet mustard condiments to work magic on, then there's no way I would agree more. If the DP sauce has been a bit generous, then the deeply fried bird could be coated well in the vinegary element to reverse its disastrous fate. The texture in the parts were tough but slightly better in the drumstick and wing parts that form 2/5 of the half basket. It will be questionable to spend $18/5 fried chicken only to get a dry texture wrapped around a thick layer of battered stone crust, extremely charred. 

But I did appreciate the buttermilk biscuits which are intensely buttered in taste, moist and soft, very moreish! The biscuit was baked thick and good for 2. Then comes the 2 salads that I loved the creaminess with a hint of tanginess in the soft boiled new potatoes. The slaw did a good job too. Slight tart and very refreshing, a good companion to ward off any greasiness. 

I enjoyed the causal dining atmosphere but less on the famed fried chicken. I guess they have other well deserving dishes which I didn't mange to try, perhaps the burrito is one? Not sure.",3,IIVTHna4vd7EOJJTKaS5uw

Looked around and there were tons of empty tables.   Was wondering why people were waiting when it looked like 1/3 of the restaurant was empty. My husband ordered the French toast brioche and because there has been some confusion in the past, we went so far as to make air circles to confirm with the waiter which French toast we wanted. (It's the round one.) After waiting way too long for our food, the waiter brought the other French toast because he ""was confused.""

She heard from a friend that the place served a pretty good lunch special... she begged to differ. I know she sets the bar pretty high when it comes to Korean comfort food, she's been cooking it all her life for her family and her restaurant. So with that in mind... she was not a happy camper. There was a lot more misses than hits and I agreed... it was just subpar. 

Service: was subpar. We repeatedly asked our waters to be filled. I would understand if they were busy, but the restaurant was barely half-filled. When we asked for a little more banchan, Mr. Server only came back with a small plate of kimchii. =/ 

Food: was just okay. We ordered several lunch specials. Portions were smaller than what we had anticipated although the presentation was pretty. (See pix)

Prices: pricey. Korean food is not cheap by any means. Since prepping includes washing and rinsing and chopping and mixing and rinsing summo and squeezing... I know the drill. I've served as a prep-er under  my kimchii-mama-in-law's direction. So the amount of work that goes in every dish is crucial to making an delectable meal. The quality at Korean Garden BBQ house is lacking luster, lacking flavor, and lacking overall yumminess. I didn't see how much lunch racked up to be, but I suppose it didn't add up to the kind of lunch she didn't think was worth paying for what she did. She was saying a whole bunch of Korean words about the place I didn't understand that didn't seem forthcoming at all.

The casino had a huge slots selection. I'm not a big slots fan; I prefer 21. But I looked in vain for a $1 minimum bet table. $5 was the lowest. Margaritas run $1-$3 for guests. They're huge (IMO). The buffet was good and reasonably priced.

My biggest gripe with this hotel (and the reason I only gave it 2 stars) is the extreme incompetence of the woman at the front desk. When I tried to check my father in law and my sister in law in to their room, the person at the desk couldn't find their reservation because she was looking for it using my father in law's FIRST name instead of his last name. She claimed his CA drivers license confused her. It wasn't until I demanded the manager that I was able to clear things up.

I wish our experience had rivaled others but it definitely did not.  We arrived at lunch time on a Saturday afternoon and were the only customers there. We were seated right away by the owner (?) and looked over the menu.  We ordered a fried chicken lunch, hush puppies and a BLT with a salad.  I didn't expect it to be speedy--good Southern food shouldn't be!--but it took 45 minutes for the chicken to arrive and my sandwich never came. The waitress said it had been overlooked (again, we're the only customers there) and would be made right away. Someone else (a manager maybe?) came over to apologize and assured me our meal would be discounted.  She specifically said to the waitress ""let me know when their bill is open; I need to put in the discount."" The owner then came over and made his appropriate apologies for the error and offered a side/dessert.  He was very friendly and accomodating.  When the bill arrived, everything appeared to be full price with no discount but I had only a moment to look over it because the waitress was literally hovering over me with her hand out trying to take my credit card.  When I got it back (I know, I should have clarified everything first) I asked her to point out the discount, as ""everything here appears to be at full menu prices"". Her only response was ""it's on there. She had to ring it in separate"" after which she just quickly walked away without another word. No explanation, no answer, no resolution.  At that point we were so irritated we just left although I'm confident that had I showed the bill to the owner or the manager they would have made good on their word.

Fellow hikers were in abundance, as I'd been warned, but on this day I didn't mind. I enjoyed the random conversations and also the occasional cheering from others in passing such as ""Good Job,"" ""You can do it,"" ""You're almost there!"" 

...But hmm I began to wonder... Did I look that in distress? That inexperienced? Or is it just that friendly of a hike? Perhaps I'm just more used to less traveled trails. I definitely had to take breaks though and at times probably did look like a staggering, dehydrated person in the desert. 

Once I made it to the top, I collapsed dramatically and gazed in awe at the panoramic view realizing this peak is smack in the middle of the city. There are the typical views of downtown Phoenix, Tempe, Papago, Camelback, etc. in addition to Red Mountain, Four Peaks and many others. 

There was humor at the top... Someone stood up and expressed a loud ""Whoaaa."" Then I heard a lady say, ""That is not a good sound to hear on top of a mountain."" Later, I overheard an old man say ""Gonna have to do a whole bunch more thinkin' on the way down."" These innocent  things made me chuckle. ...And the old man was right. 

The humans were interesting... I met a couple of guys who said they made it to the top in 27 minutes but that the last time they did it in 24. Impressive. There was also a helpful man who new the names of almost all of the mountains in the distance. I said something cheezy to him...something like, ""I love a man who knows his mountains."" 

This was an enjoyable hike. Beautiful and a good workout. I got to make some friends...human and non (an adorably fearless squirrel scavenging around at the top) and shared a number of high-fives.

We were offered and ordered a pre-meal cocktail. 
At that time we met the staff and were asked if we had a show that evening. We said no, that dinner was the highlight of the evening. 

Shortly after we ordered our cocktails we placed our orders. I was a bit surprised they did not offer to explain anything on the menu; however we were discussing the Tasting Menu so I assume they knew we already wanted that. We placed our orders and before we could finish our cocktails the first course was at the table. The Sommelier arrived, who was funny and cordial, to describe the first wine. The first course was yellowtail, and delicious, my husband got the crab which was divine. As soon as we finished the food it was cleared and nearly as quickly they brought the glasses for the next course. Again, I was surprised because we all still had half our pre dinner cocktail and at least half of the first glass of wine. The second course came, amazing risotto, and the speediness repeatedly itself again. Finally, my husband asked them to slow down because the course were coming so fast we were barely able finish our previous course and unable to finish our drinks. The waiter apologized and mentioned they were used to getting people to shows. We stated again we didn't have a show. He said he would take cues from my husband. At this point, the service switched, the sommelier came out for 2nd wine, but not the 3rd and despite my husband trying to signal the waiter repeatedly it took 3-4 attempts (understandably he had other tables) to catch his attention so it took almost 3.5 more hours to complete our remaining courses.

She said she'd give me a call once they had it and that either way they'd call me if they didn't have it so I can go to another store. She took my information down on Tuesday, it's now Saturday and I haven't heard from anyone. Really would like to not live off the samples forever and need to know if I should go to another store to get this foundation. What gives?
----
I gotta say I've been pretty disappointed by the level of customer service this location has and have agreed with one of the other reviews about not once being greeted. Normally I don't like being bothered when I'm shopping but when you're spending the money on high quality products, and there are so many here, you definitely want to make sure your getting the right one and being able to ask their expertise and even get acknowledged when you are in the store goes a long way.
I've been to this location 4 times and 3 out of the 4 times I spent about 20-30min walking around and not one person acknowledged me or asked if I needed help. I wasn't sure if I just didn't look the part for them to care about me enough as a customer, either way it wasn't a good feeling and unsure about what to get I left all 3 times without a purchase. 
I decided to give this location another shot, it's the most convenient and I was in desperate need of more foundation. Down to the last drop I wanted to try a different foundation that had great reviews but I needed to be matched. Walking in from the parking lot I was literally thinking how much time it would take until someone noticed me.
Things weren't looking good but I think people should keep in mind to that this is a small location, most Sephora's have handfuls of employees always moving around the store and a dedicated greeter at the front. This location probably only has about 2-3 employees that I've seen at any given time. 
About 5min in Emma saved the day and swooped by to ask me if I needed help. I let her know I wanted to get color matched, let her know my skin concerns and we were off to the races. During my mini consult I remembered what I liked about Sephora compared to most other beauty stores like Ulta. I feel like when you can get an employee then they are devoted to you during that time, they aren't running off to multitask other customers, they don't rush you in and out, they really hone in on what you want and need and want to make you look good. 
Emma did a fantastic job of nailing the color I needed for my skin, we shared beauty and cleansing routines. I just really felt like I could take my time and hers and she had no problem showing me how to use products. I ended up spending about $50 more than I thought I would on other products because I felt like I had that initial direction from her and then I could go through and try other things with confidence. I left the store feeling super happy with my purchases and excited to implement them into my daily routine. While they were out of the foundation I wanted she gave me a nice amount of the product as a sample to hold me over until they got some in. 
Kudos to Emma, I hope when I return that she is there to help, I felt like she really went above and beyond to help me out and having that 1 on 1 time with the employees at Sephora makes you feel special, and it's why I've been moving away from Ulta and willing to come here more and more for my makeup needs.",1,wYTMFvw3_UetcniRKxtUzg

Made an appointment for 2 pedicures and 2 gel manicures plus a brow waxing. 

Pedicure was ok. Nothing special. Gel manicure for me was rushed because a ""regular"" came in as Gina got started with me. As a result, my cuticles were cut in 2 places and bleeding. Each layer of my gel manicure was not allowed to baked the minimum 60 seconds and as a result my manicure is peeling off in less than 5 days on 4 nails.

Again, pedicure nothing special. And chairs are mediocre in regard to massage action. 

The eye brow waxing was sloppy. Area between the brows was even done!

Ad for it on Yelp. I was going back and forth between 4 stars and 5, but the new, different appetizers and rolls made it!

Location: 
pretty central, and close to UNLV. I live on the East side and didn't mind the drive. Easy to get to and when we got there for dinner, the area had lots of parking spaces available. 

Atmosphere: 
Smaller area & Casual with an open vibe (lots of windows make up 2 of the 4 walls), dark floors/tables. A mix of chairs and stools against the wall. Similar to Sakana. There's a bar towards the front that seat about 6 leopl

Service: 
our waitress and the chefs were very friendly! Our waters were always refilled in a timely manner and when our waitress was busy, one of the chefs brought it to our table. It did take some time to get some of our rolls/appetizers, but luckily the vibe was calm in the restaurant which made us less impatient. 

Food: 
THIS is what gets the stars. The fish to rice ratio on the nigiri is generous and awesome! And Honestly, it was the variety of different appetizers & rolls that other restaurants rarely have that they do. 
-Cucumber rolls! (Rolls wrapped in cucumber rather than rice)
-Ono Special box roll! 
-Hirata bun (pork belly in baos)
-Pork Belly Taco
-Poke Tacos
-Seared salmon miso nigiri
-Scalloped wrapped in bacon skewers (others have this, but here it's much bigger in size and Less burnt crispy)
-Fried octopus (better than crispy calamari!) 
-Takoyaki 
-Truffle fries
Price: 
Similar to other AYCE sushi places, but actually a bit cheaper. Other places I've been to charge as high as 26.95 for dinner and here it is 24.98! Way better deal and still a good sushi experience.

I dont know if I went in on a day where the girl making burritos (I have no idea her name bc she had no name tag) was having a horrible day, or if she was just trying to hurry and leave. I went in at 920 after Beatles Love and ordered my normal chicken burrito. There was 1 scoop of brown rice and 3 people, she asked what type of rice and I replied white, she then turned and rolled her eyes sooo hard I thought they were gonna get stuck. I advised her I'm fine with brown and she carried on, the chicken was wayy too charred and she put like a freakin cup full of hot salsa on my chicken. I then asked for cheese, sour cream, and gauc. She had about a sprinkles worth of cheese left, no sour cream and 1 spoon full of gauc, again there was 3 patrons waiting. She then replies, we have no sour cream, its 930 already... OK YOU CLOSE AT 10 AND I SHOW HER IT WAS ONLY 920 AND YOU HAVE NO SOUR CREAM!? She then gives me 1/4 of a scoop of gauc and proceeds to roll my burrito. I was pretty annoyed bc why am I gonna pay for something that doesnt include everything I want. She then asks the patrons behind me if they were alright not having sour cream, they also have the look of disappointment like myself,  At this point the cashier chimes in and says ""I can make some real quick""

OK, its at this point my pina colada has kicked in 100% and I say ""are you serious? I asked for some and you did not offer me any, yet you offer these folks some?"" She rolls her eyes and pays me no mind. Throughout this visit I have been patient and just went with the flow, but no way in hell are you gonna piss on me. I tell the cashier that the ladies attitude needs to be brought up to the manager and she turns and says ""I did not give you an attitude (with an attitude btw)"" and Im shocked! She says this in front of other patrons and workers! I told the cashier my comment quietly, but she went and put me on blast!

Perhaps their 2nd shift cook isn't putting the love into the food that the 1st shift cook does? Who knows. All I know is this. I'm going to rank my grievances with this place in order. 

1. BBQ chicken is not supposed to be unseasoned fried chicken. Most places smoke their chicken then pull it. That seems to be the standard which I have began to expect. I know the menu doesn't say ""pulled chicken"", but when I see chicken on the menu in a BBQ place, I sure don't expect a bland fried chicken leg/thigh combo. 

2. Burnt ends not even edible. A little fat is one thing, but an entire appetizer of burnt ends and ALL of it was fat? Cmon now...That's just lazy. Burnt ends are basically the end piece of a smoked brisket. They are known for being HEAVY on the smoke flavor, while also very tender and flavorful. The burnt ends I got at porkopolis were just pieces of fat cut off of an unseasoned brisket. If anything, it just opened my eyes to how bad the brisket was going to be, because I tasted NO smoke in the burnt ends, which is a really bad thing for BBQ. 

3. The brisket not only lacked seasoning and smoke flavor, it was tough as beef jerky! This was the worst brisket I've ever eaten. Wow...Unseasoned, fatty pieces of brisket that wasn't smoked enough(IF AT ALL) and was tough because it wasn't cooked slow enough. As a brisket lover, this was a sin to me. 

Those 3 things ruined my meal for me. The pulled pork wasn't bad. It was noticeably more smoked, but AGAIN, not seasoned enough. It was bland. 

The BBQ sauce they feature there is actually pretty good in my opinion. Brady's bbq has some good flavor. Too bad it's being wasted on VERY POORLY cooked bbq meats. 

The sides were decent. The cornbread wasn't bad, a little too cakey but had good flavor. The mac and cheese wasn't bad either. The cream corn was something both me and my girlfriend liked a lot, so good job there. The baked beans tasted like hormel chili. We couldn't finish that nor did we take it with us. Finally, the apple crisp with ice cream was tasty. The dessert was by far my favorite part of an otherwise forgettable meal. Honestly I hope they figure this BBQ thing out and fire whoever cooked last night. Find someone who knows how to operate a smoker and season their food please. 

Finally, the service was good. The tall, pretty, blonde girl was very nice. It wasn't her fault!

This place is so close to home. I really hope they get their act together so we can try them again.",4,2-10dT9Ep0I1NkdvR3IMwg

The menu seamed a bit pricey to me only because entrees don't come with sides so an entree and a side together already put one person at $40. This is not an issue, just wasn't expecting the pricey-ness. The food tasted very good and well seasoned!! The pasta I order was spicy and very delicious I think it was a shrimp and scallion linguine in a creole cream sauce. Very delicious. The ceasar salad was very small for $8 it was about 1 cup of salad. However, the dressing tasted like buttermilk, as if the dressing was hand-made (made from scratch) I appreciate that culinary delight.

Here is why I gave them a 4 instead of a 5-star review. Their clam chowder had no clams in it. The particle of clam I perceived within the soup was the literally the size of a grain of rice. I kid you not, it was literally that small and maybe 5 pieces that same size in there. That's not a clam chowder soup, that's more like ""clam remnant"" soup. I didn't appreciate that at all. Didn't really care for the compliment bread either I think they used sourdough bread ...I wasn't satisfied with that. A traditional dinner roll or bread without that sour taste is a much better option. The entree portion size was s bit small too.

All in all I would still go back their again. The entrees are the best part of the menu. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone :)",0,Hxtez16DnVkMYj6kXvtpXw

Major points for the rotating (random) assortment of ""small pieces,"" (""orphans,"" as another reviewer pointed out) which are basically just the broken-off chunks from larger slices, priced at around a few bucks each. 

The selection from local dairies is great (especially for tourists like me!) but despite the basically friendly service, I did feel a hint of annoyance from the cheesemongers when I asked my fifth or sixth question. Fromagination is clearly a popular destination for out-of-towners looking for the ""local experience,"" but the high volume foot-traffic seems to take its toll on the service. I have high expectations for artisanal shops -- Isn't personalized service a rudimentary characteristic of such places? --

She had two tables reserved for all of us and she and the staff were top notch with tending to us, serving food and drinks in an incredibly timely manner, and checking up with us regularly.

This place was a pinch difficult to find at night. No lit up sign, the windows are covered with green curtains (so from outside it looks quite dim), The easiest way to navigate to it is to look across the street from Bistro La Bon (or two buildings over to the left from Slate).

The water here was really good. Not rubbishy tap water. It was filtered (or distilled?) and had a hint of cucumber to it-- quite lovely. I tried their special warm sangria: warm red wine, brandy, spices, and bits of apple and orange. Excellent for a chilly night.

I tried an Indian Taco (which I was confused about how it was Indian, aside from the naan shell... I got more of a chili-over-bread impression) and the Roasted Vegetable Panini with yellow squash and sun-dried tomatoes, and root veggie chips on the side.

Another Resturant that I've been visiting for about 10 years. I'm going keep this short and sweet.

Let's start with the good:
Great place for eating ANYTIME of the day as it's 24/7.
The cashier there is very friendly and funny.
Food quality is good and the portion is decent.
T-Bones has always been good with consistency.
Steaks are great. I cannot speak about the burgers because I always get a steak there.

Now, onto the bad.
Not so much bad but here goes:

only had one bad experience with steak there. I ordered a rare steak and I couldn't eat it. I don't know if it's the type of steak but it was gross. So I only eat medium rare there..other places like keg or red lobster I'll take a rare steak. 

Price increase of the steak special from 11.99 to 16 or 17.99! Really??? One special will not fill me up so I don't go there as much as I use to because of the price increase.

T bones is a good place to chill and have a good steak and fries or mashed potato. 

3/5 due to the price increase

Here is a pic of the 32 oz combo and 16 oz combo

I brought in my car because I had an issue with vibration at freeway speed. I thought my tires were out of balance, but a tire shop informed me that I had two bent rims. I knew Snail repaired bent/scratched rims, so I brought in my car and figured I'd get the wheels powder coated in the process. 

$400 later, my wheels looked fantastic. Every bit as good as new. They informed me that the bends were so slight that they required minimal work to straighten and thus didn't charge me. Awesome! I was a happy customer. Until I drove my car. 

Yep, vibration still there at freeway speed. Maybe slightly better, but nowhere near being gone. I brought my car back to them. I informed them that the vibration was still there, and to be fair, they didn't charge me to straighten the rims. I was willing to pay the price to straighten the wheels, since that's why I came in originally and they didn't charge me for that. They said they'd check it out, so I left the car there and went out of town. 

No communication. I called when I got back in town and was informed my car was done. Cool. When I went to pick it up, I was informed that three of my rims were bent and needed to be straightened. They said my tires had a weird wear pattern and that it might still cause vibration until I replace them. $480. What??!? 

They charged me to RE-powdercoat the wheels they just powdercoated for me. I would not have had to do that if they would have straightened them correctly the first time. 

When asked about it, the woman behind the counter pointed to the invoice and said ""you signed it and agreed to the price."" Uh oh...my fault for not reading what I signed. I usually do. I own that. Still...the work that needed to be done was NOT explained to me prior. I was just handed the thing to sign with zero explanation that my wheels would need to be refinished and they would charge me for it a second time.

Dark, more dark and darker still, its interior is either straight from the 1970s - I described in as ""the sort of bar one could see in the show 'Charlie's Angels' during the Farrah Fawcett era"" - or constructed to look like such. Either way, it's a huff of smokey air in the pre-fab, ""let's have consumer-driven fun"" world of Las Vegas. The enclosed, circular fireplace in the center of the first room is a nice touch and, along with the votive candles on the tables, a good source of light. If you're anti-hipster (whether patron or staff), this probably isn't the place for you, since a chunk of the crowd and the workers are dressed in dark clothing and sneaker-shod, have varying degrees of body art, slouch, smoke and possess a disaffected stare. Like Don't Tell Mama, this place is much easier to access if you start early (around 8 or 9 p.m.), especially on the weekend. While there are available street spots in this part of downtown, many of the reviews mention using a pay lot; this wasn't an issue for us, as we were staying at the El Cortez, just down the street and the hotel had ample parking in its structure. Please note that there was a supposed credit card minimum when we were in on Saturday, 5/19/12, which was $15, so my friend bought a shot. The crowd seemed neither friendly nor unfriendly and the noise level was low enough to accommodate conversation (again, remember we were here between 9 and 10 p.m. on a Saturday). Good jukebox with indie stuff - big surprise! - and no cover make this a no-brainer, especially for someone who opts for a downtown hotel stay instead of the strip.

Online ordering was very easy to use. Ordered a large, regular crust garlic sauce pizza & a Cleveland Burger. First, pizza was ready when I arrived & order was correct. Now, to the actual food. I would say that the crust was a bit overlooked for my taste. It was quite crisp but not burnt. I felt like the sauce was non existent. I understand that garlic sauce is a light sauce, but I have had some great garlic sauces. Plus having only cheese, I should be able to taste garlic. Overall, bland. Now the Cleveland Burger - think a Roman Burger. I would venture they cook the burger in the pizza oven. The edges of the burgers are extremely crispy, yes, crispy. Even with the Italian dressing, cheese, tomato & lettuce, it still crunched when I bit into it. I would be a good sandwich if the burger was properly cooked. Sorry, I don't like crunchy burgers.  With so many options in Mentor for pizza, I think I will stay with my tried and true favorite.",0,5SHdE-AxSUD7m9PhSpwMVg

I'm all about the food and drinks. I will say that it's a nice touch that guys get a blue colored menu and girls get a pink colored menu.

I suggested we come here because my friend used to be obsessed with Green Grotto's baked mochis. When I saw that this place had a mochi waffle, we decided to check it out.My friend and I both got waffles and I got a sweet potato latte because it sounded like something that only Cafe Princess offers. I enjoyed the sweet potato latte because it tasted like frothed ginger milk, albeit a tad too sweet. 


 Sadly, the moffle (their name, I didn't coin it) tasted very rice-y and the texture was sort of like chewing gum. It definitely didn't taste like a glutinous rice mochi. My friend called it awffle (like as in awful, not like awwww it's so cute-waffle).

I, on the other hand, ordered a nuts waffle and their regular waffle batter is delicious! It was light and fluffy and the nuts complemented the vanilla ice-cream and waffle well. The cookies n creme ice-cream tasted off though and I'm not sure if it's because of freezer burn or if this batch was weird. I don't think they make the ice-cream in-house either, in case we have any ice-cream aficionados reading this review.

Just the other day, I had this experience: We were done shopping, so I sent my 12-year-old son to return the basket to the store. Because he's a bit oblivious to the crazy drivers at this awful parking lot, I tend to stay out of the car and watch.

Sure enough, one person was having trouble pulling out because they were distracted or confused. In their defense, though, they were being careful, and I appreciate that. On the other hand, it posed a dilemma for my son -- he wasn't sure how to cross the parking lot with this person going back and forth. 

My son finally found an opening and crossed over to me. That's when the honking began. No, it wasn't the person pulling out, it was the elderly couple impatiently waiting for the person to finish pulling out.

Now this is one of those huge cars with a very, very loud horn. In fact, it's the single loudest car horn I've ever experienced, and the thing was deafening.

Why bring this all up? Because this sums up the experience of shopping at this particular Trader Joe's. The shoppers, particularly the winter visitors, are ridiculously impatient and sometimes downright nasty. Not as bad as our local Costco, which I wrote about previously, but pretty horrendous nonetheless.

So what about the store itself? Well, they have a number of problems that I've not experienced as much at other stores. 1. The produce never looks fresh and their selection isn't as interesting as some of the other Valley stores. I don't know why that is. 2. Older food is almost always put in front of the fresher stuff. I'm always looking through the back of the shelves for the fresher foods. Some TJ's do this while others don't. 2. The store may just be too darned busy for it's own good, and it may be time to put another one in north Scottsdale. Sadly, no new stores are planned for Arizona in the near future.

As a whole, we'll continue going to this store because of its proximity. On the other hand, I don't understand why some Scottsdale stores bring out some of the nastiest people in the world while others don't, but it's frustrating and a bit sad.",1,KlH-uX3TBG9V0Z3Bk6ShUg

We had to drop off our booze for the bus and a 20 for ice, but it was in this weird sort of shady bus lot with old broken down buses.

I thought the show itself was classy and not trashy at all. It's mainly for pure entertainment and a good laugh. I didn't understand any of the jokes because they were in French, but Mado really knew how to spice up the crowd. He picked on people, like us New Yorkers, that weren't laughing (due to the language barrier) and decided to translate some of the dirty jokes in English for us.

1st the good. They have a Spencer and a decent food court.  They have all the stores I want to shop at and the sales tax is less than the Cuy.  Oh Fuji the Japanese place is pretty dam good.

The Bad:

We went on a Sat before the dinner rush, it was perfect. (430pm) Service was great throughout and our waitress was knowledgeable about the menu and how things were prepped there (refreshing!)
Ordered - the calamari ($10) and the haddock and chips ($16). Both were great. (also available - pollock, cod and at a pricier cost - halibut for $23) 
The calamari is just lightly floured and very lightly fried. Not a drop of oil was seen on the plate!
The fish (2 pieces) was also cooked perfectly and the restaurant makes its own yummy tartar sauce! The deliciously hot fries were cut in house and left unsalted so you could season them how you want. The malt vinegar on the table was a nice addition too. Hot sauce can be brought to you as well as extra lemon, you just need to ask! The only thing I did not see on the plate was coleslaw - this was a first for me.
We spoke to the owner on our way out and he was a great conversationalist! He loves talking about fish and knows his stuff.
The look and feel of the cozy restaurant makes you feel like you are in a roadside/seaside shanty in NS. I loved this aspect of the place and the beer was nice and cold!

We were seated in a corner booth and the walls around us were visibly dirty. The server, though friendly and attentive, was pretty clueless.  I told her that our daughter had a peanut allergy and if I could see the food allergy menu.  She had no idea what I was talking about.  When we asked if there were any items that have peanuts in them or were cooked with peanut sauce or peanut oil, she said the hummus.  While it sounded strange, we didn't say anything at the moment.  Later when she brought our food, I asked if the hummus was really made with peanuts or maybe she meant chickpeas?   She said she had to ask the kitchen and get back to us.  Overall, our food was okay, but nothing great.  As food allergies are becoming more common and some are potentially life threatening, such as a severe peanut allergy, I think it's important that the staff is more knowledgeable and better prepared to handle questions about their menu.",2,TVI9-hPUn6zTuhYPAlipXQ

He explained things well, visited me every day before and after surgery (even on the weekend) and best of all never once made us feel like he was rushed. He stood there answering even our dumbest questions. He didn't have what I would call an exuberant personality, but write frankly I much prefer a very stable, confident personality in a neurosurgeon. I even asked if he would be willing to call and discuss my case with my uncle, a well seasoned radiologist, and he said sure, took down his number, and called him a few hours later. My uncle was adequately impressed by him, which gave us an even higher level of comfort. His assistant told my wife she would call her during surgery at certain intervals and you could almost set your clock by them she was so consistent.

We were booked for a non-smoking King room, didn't get it. 3 Hotel rooms for a 2 night stay is extremely inconvenient, and the way this was handled was at best disappointing and unfortunately will not be back to this hotel. So let's start the story by saying this was our first time away from our 15mo old daughter. Upon check in we were offered an upgrade to a mini suite for an additional $15 a night....who wouldn't jump on that for a romantic weekend getaway?! Walking into the room the smoke hit you like a brick wall! The windows open to air out, it was almost as if the person was still in there chain smoking. Our friends walked in and her eyes started burning and watering. Immediately my husband calls the front desk to change rooms (15mins from initial check in), they informed him that they didn't have another mini suite to move us to, so he said I'll take our old room without the upgrade, that's fine. They then tell him that they don't have that either and that they only have a 2 Queen non smoking....we take that. So basically it seemed as though they over sold, never had our king non smoking and were trying to make money off of their mistake. They said they would call us tomorrow to switch our room to what we had booked.

We were seated immediately on the patio, and we quickly obtained a table.  That was the last ""quick"" part about the meal.  Service was slow for drinks, orders, food, and bill.  It was okay as we enjoyed the waterfront dining, but it got to be a little tiresome as the evening progressed.  

The appetizer was the ""PCC Trio"", which included a pimento cheese that I simply haven't adjusted to yet.  The pico was flavorful, and I really enjoyed the pita chips.

The beer I had hoped for was not available (Wicked Weed Coolcumber, which I had there in June and it was awesome in 100 degree heat), but that happens and I'm not docking my review for that.  However, I will fault the place for how long it took to get a beer.  I'd say the inside was at about 40% full, and the patio seating was almost full, but the place just didn't seem busy enough to justify the delays.  Our server was friendly, and we liked her, we just wish maybe we'd have seen a little more of her.  

For dinner I had the Pacific Cod sandwich, fired in a tempura batter and served with fries.  I ordered a caesar salad as well, which I would have thought would be served with the appetizer course, but it wasn't.  The timing of the meal was just off with the appetizers and mains.  The fish was enormous, and it was good, but not great. 

Everyone seemed to like the food, but the delays in all aspects of the service put a serious damper on the evening. We'll try it again if only for the amazing view (and my favorite thing - dining under palm trees!), but I'm going to be hoping for an improvement on the service side.

Finally, I feel like maybe this place isn't sure what it wants to be.  The decor inside is attempting to be upscale, as it some of the menu, but yet it caters to people coming in off their boats docked outside dressed for lake activities.  I think there's nothing wrong with it, but the formal atmosphere inside clashes with the clientele.

Guksu and Noodle offer a wide variety of your mainstay Korean fare (they even have the trendy melted cheese/bbq platter and fried chicken) but specializes in noodles. The place is clean and modern looking with pleasing wooden paneling and furniture and good lighting. My group ordered a variety of different noodles as well as a salad, the matcha pork belly, and a couple of meat sides.

The noodles themselves were nothing to write home about in my opinion, but the broths were quite flavourful and unique. They make good use of sous-vide for their poached eggs and their meat, which pairs well with their noodle-saving hot and cold broths.

Besides the mediocre noodles, my other gripe would be with the matcha pork belly. In short, they were the most interesting bite I had, but highly inconsistent! The front couple of slices had the matcha taste and the back slices did not have them at all. For the pieces actually properly executed, the sous vide belly made for a nice combination of savoury, fatty, and a nice final hit of that vegetal/herbaceous matcha---I was pleasantly caught off guard. The slices that did not have them? Underseasoned, nearly flavourless and supremely boring.

It seems to me Guksu and Noodle is a very promising concept that falls short in execution--- a jack of many trades but master of none (sadly, not even of noodles). Overall my group had a positive experience (nice staff and atmosphere), but I'm a little hesitant to revisit.",0,iCMGR_a7BuFPqZBw-IPNiA

The rice on the rolls was horrible the rolls where to large and thin hard to grab with the shop stick, I been eating Japanese food for year and I am an expert with the stick and I can tell if the rice is been cooked properly. All the rolls where very small for the price and with out presentation, they fall a part and when I told the waiter to please take this back he said that the manager can only take half because I eat half of the roll. I personally think that the manager can even count because it came with 5 pieces and I returned 4 they fall a parts on my cloth ruining my shirt and causing a bad experience. This is the last time that we are going to eat here and if you think that this is not bad please walk in to the restroom first it is horrible I can only imagine how clean is the kitchen. We spent 150 dollars in a table of 3.! Bad place do not eat there.",2,FATVhcCz45TXIx7mAMGRmw

We were seated basically immediately. I love that they've changed the inside of the place. It has a cool vibe, though it seemed like it can get a little loud.

I got the Western Omelette and added tomatoes. It was really good. I liked the hash browns a lot (home fries, really). And they have cinnamon raisin toast which is the best thing everrrrr. My husband got a burger. He liked it and they have wavy chips, another favorite.

If you're a big foodie, I don't know if you'll be thrilled? But for an overflowing omelette of goodies, it is a great spot!

The place is kind of small in my opinion, the service is a little bit slow. There was only 1 server working when I went and most of the tables were full. Clean and nice restaurant though. This isn't the best Middle Eastern food restaurant around but it is decent. The prices are reasonable for pretty big portion of food. 
Food isn't bad but it wasn't great. I tried one of the mix combo that had gyro, chicken and something else I can't remember. Gyro and the missing meat were okay in my opinion but the chicken was pretty great. I really like eating rice and yogurt so I do tend to use a lot of yogurt. So the problem I ran into was they're a little bit stingy on giving me more yogurt even though I have to pay like $1 and some change for 1/4 of a yogurt scoop. Anyways, the food was decent enough to make me full but I wouldn't be craving their cooking anytime soon.

For our hotel, we usually go the cheapo route so we can spend more money on gambling and dining. This year, I decided to book the Tropicana because it is now owned by Hilton. I have gold status with them so I knew our breakfast would be comped at least. The $49 room rate was decent too.

I booked a bungalow room thinking it would be nice to have a balcony, but it soon became clear that the AC wasn't functioning properly. I asked to be moved to another room, and the front desk said they would send security over to open up a nearby room. We waited half an hour and no one showed up. So I went to the front desk, and the woman offered to upgrade us to a ""mini-suite"" in the newer tower. What a joke! It was just a regular room at the end of the hall with a small triangle's worth of extra square footage. Oh well, can't get too uppity about a $49 room, right?

I was hoping things would be better on the casino floor, but it was much worse. My husband and I were sitting at the automated roulette table for 30 minutes and watched 4 cocktail waitresses walk right past us. We cashed out and moved over to the bar to play some video poker. The bartender was nice and helped us promptly, but he clearly had no idea what he was doing behind the bar. I ordered a french martini and my husband got a manhattan. Both were made with the wrong liquors.

The pool area is clean and not too crowded. We didn't enjoy it all that much though because of the god awful music playing (I think a 12 year old girl choose the playlist) and the retina-burning level of chlorine in the pool.

What did save the Tropicana was the great breakfast. The buffet had a decent selection of the usual suspects, and the quality was all average or better. I loved the omlette bar, and the guy working it was awesome. So much fun and very competent. I wasn't his only fan. A group of ladies doing business travel asked to take their picture with him.

Elegantly decorated in rich, dark colours, low lighting, upscale furniture and an intimate ambiance, this place is great to bring a date to.  

The menu is contemporary Italian, with it's decent selection of anitpasti's, pastas and mains.  If I ever see beef carpaccio on the menu I have to get it as a base of comparison.  For mains we got the pappardelle with wild boar ragu, and the butternut squash and veal stuffed ravioli(?) with pistachios and truffle oil.  

Carpaccio was beautifully pink, super vibrant colouring, with a fresh taste to boot.  Pastas were good not great, nothing to really complain about, but nothing to rave about either.  I'd say the stuffed Veal pasta was better than my pappardelle as it had more depth of flavours and textures.  The pistachios were a fun inclusion.

For dessert we split the apple strudel with pear compote and vanilla ice cream.  The pastry itself wasn't hot enough and thus not flaky enough to  cut up with my fork - it felt like I had to fight with it in order to break off a piece.  Meanwhile the ice cream was still very frozen and rock solid. 

The service was very friendly and polite albeit a little smothering.  Our waiter would come by every 3 minutes to ask us something and thank us profusely when we accepted his offer to refill our water glasses.

$100 for two, an app, a cocktail, two mains, cappacino and dessert.  Pretty reasonable.  To be fair, I would like to give Carisma 3.5 stars, as it was a pleasant dining experience. I just can't see myself wanting to go back.",5,6b4yYexmPQglmNdNum531Q

The bad: When we unpacked the tent we found that it was filthy and had several holes along the seams of the tent.

I just used the bathroom and have no soap to wash up with? 

     I got to the front counter and ordered A chicken sandwich and onion rings. The register lady informed me that their fryer is broken and they can't make any fries or onion rings. Great! When did it stop working? Yesterday she explained. I told her just to bring out the sandwich. She took off to go do something and I was standing there, I realized that if the fryer is down, there was zero chance that they can make a fried chicken sandwich either. When she reappeared I asked her about that and she had a deer in the headlights look. That was enough to tell me I wouldn't be getting a chicken sandwich today either. I got my money back and got out of there.

     When a patron can't get soap in the bathroom just minutes after the place has opened, that tells me that the manager is not completing their opening check list correctly. Any manager worth their own salt would at least stick their head in the bathrooms to see if it is stocked before they open the restaurant.

    The other major issue is that the fryer at this location was broke down on Saturday and Sunday. The weekends are the biggest sales days for restaurants. Management cannot allow the fryer to be down all weekend. You have to get someone in there to get it fixed.

What's not fine, however, was that four couples bypassed us (there were three of us), and we ended up sitting at a two-person table. Two of us had to basically squeeze into a one person spot. The seating was extremely disorganized, which probably explained why the wait was so long. Customer service was poor, no one apologized for the wait, nor for shoving us into a tiny spot. 

Food came half an hour after we were seated.

We ordered the savory french toast and croissant Benny with peameal bacon (their specials). Overall quality of food was average, definitely not worth the long wait in the cold. The side salad was good though. We also ordered two croissants cos we were starving, the plates that the croissants were served on were hot, so we thought we were getting warm fluffy croissants. However the croissants were cold and hard, guess they've been sitting in their bakery for a while.. 

Overall, poor experience with this place, food was really average, I paid 22$, which was pricy given the quality of food and service. 

(If you are getting your food packed, make sure you triple check to ensure that you are actually bringing your own food home. I went home, expecting to find my Benny in the bag, and found a half eaten chocolate cake instead. Gross!)",2,KqoB3eNDf1qQJK1J2Wo5ew

We came in just before 7 on a Saturday and the restaurant was empty. Like other reviewers noted, it was rather empty for the entire time we were there. One other table came in about 10 minutes after we arrived and another came in just as we were having dessert. 

We both ended up going for the Prix-Fixe menu. I had the California Salad to start, which was a rather nice beginning to my meal. A little bit too much of the fairly sweet pomegranate dressing on a pretty plain salad but it was good just the same.

 I ended up having the rack of lamb as my main, which was excellent! The lamb was cooked very well, nice crispy and flavorful outside. A very cute little tower of mashed potatoes, plenty of super yum gravy and a nice mix of vegetables on the side. The main was one of those meals that makes you stop in the middle of eating and go ""wow"". I was really impressed with my meal. I was afraid I wouldn't be hungry enough for dessert but the portion was just right. My brother had the paella and I got the chance to try some and it was fantastic as well. Great flavor, some good heat to it as well and a really fresh taste. He noted that he'd had paella at a place in the city that was known for the paella and his meal at Valens was way better.

For dessert I ended up going with creme brulee and it was pretty good. Not the best I've ever had but I liked how it was served, in a fairly wide bowl, giving a good ratio of sugar to creme. My main issue with it was that it wasn't a consistent temperature throughout. Part of it was rather warm and then it got cold again towards the middle. Odd...

We got very good service, the one server that was working had a good balance, not too intrusive but she didn't disappear for long periods of time either. I had a cocktail and my brother had two glasses of wine and our bill came to around $75 total. Not bad for a nice meal out with drinks. 

I'd definitely come back here, especially for a date (as Vivek suggests) or with people who may have varying tastes as the menu seems to have quite a bit on it. I did like how nice and quiet it was and how there was no sense of being rushed AT ALL. The excellent service and the lamb pushed this review to a four for me.",3,vJGLEHyhCs9V-5fAe-xx3w

I came back in a few weeks later to get my oil changed and was shown that color chart for brake fluid and was told it was awful and the price to have my brake fluid flushed...  I asked the guy why they would not have done that when replacing the brakes and he fumbled over his words and told me they would do it free of charge.  At the end he claimed that sometimes there will be residue after they clean out the brakes and that is what had happened...  Do not trust these people!

When i picked up my food, this restaurant looks a tad mysterious from the outside but on the inside it is very modern, almost an upscale take with big booths great for medium sized parties or intimate dinners. 

Ordered a lamb vindaloo, a butter naan and a garlic naan that came out to 24$ before tips. I thought $15 for a lamb vindaloo and $3.50 naans was a bit pricey but apparently thats what the Indian restaurants around UNLV charges so this was my first test.

Pros
-Lamb Vindaloo, although not spicy (medium), was tasty that came with A LOT OF LAMB. Good cuts of lamb as the pieces were neither tough or fatty. 
-For $15, the portion of vindaloo was well sized and the rice it came with was more than enough
-Very well packaged for takeout to ensure none of it spills on its journey to the stomach

Cons
-Weak naan, was not big and fluffy. It is possible that it became soggy on the ride home but they did not have crispy edges that the good naan have.
-Butter naan was not buttery and although garlic naan had garlic, the flavors did not transfer to the palate. (Surcharge for garlic was understandable, but for 'unbuttery' butter?)
-Pricey naan considering it it was about $3.50 each.

Will definitely come back to try the buffet soon, but will try the other Indian restaurants nearby before I order takeout from here again.",1,3gX0SnispHbO2QRdGipt0g

We visited for dinner and for breakfast: 
For dinner I can highly recommend the TAGLIATELLE BOLOGNAISE. $28  
WOW.  just WOW. Succulent, fresh and tender pasta and meat.  absolutely delectable sauce.  it was amazing.
The Amuse Bouche was a lovely surprise.  Delicious salmon tartare.  I could have nibbled my way through the entire tray of them!  The spiced cashews were nice too.

I wasn't crazy about the offerings on the kids menu - they seemed way overpriced ($12 hot dog, $16 tomato basil pasta) and my son wanted Mac and Cheese which wasn't listed.  So I asked if they would accommodate us. Holy cow.
The Chef's Mac N Cheese was so unbelievably good I would go back and request that anytime: For ME!  The chef made cavatappi pasta and an amazing bechamel sauce, with buttercrumb topping - and charged us $12.  SO worth it!!!!  I polished off what my son didn't finish.  I was not ashamed in the least.

For Breakfast:
I devoured the NANTUCKET EGGS: Grilled jumbo lump crab cakes, poached eggs, baby spinach and hollandaise sauce.  Scrumptious.  I loved them.  The crab was oh-so very fresh and in nice big pieces.  Hollandaise sauce was on the side so you can control the portion.  My husband felt it was too rich a dish.  But I just loved it. 

here's why I didn't give it 5 stars:
I did not mind paying the entree prices, but thought the ordinary items were overpriced. 
An iced tea was $7.  seriously?  
A single scrambled egg (for my son) at $6 
Each coffee was $7.  
and the big kicker was an 8oz glass of whole milk was $8.00  sheesh.

The breakfast potatoes were soggy when they should've been crisp. Definitely taken out of a warming tray. 

The pancakes which was the whole reason we came here were tough! I couldn't cut thru them with a fork and i had to stop eating after 1 bite because chewing the hard shell was too much for me. 

Coffee was only refilled once. For a breakfast that costs $30, I expect it to be fresh. And I got something less than that.

I knew from a quick peruse of googlemaps that there were 3 ethiopian places near by, so we thought we'd try one. Our first stop was a quick run-in and run-the-heck-out again of Queen of Sheba (See my review: http://www.yelp.ca/biz/the-queen-of-sheba-restaurant-toronto#hrid:nqC7Km2BiOMgmfsjC7uP1Q) and Nazareth had a huge line, so we popped into African Palice. 

It didn't take long for our beautiful veggie platter to arrive, along with two small plates of a folded, flat bread like substance. It was drool at first sight, and we were pumped to dive in--until we realized that we had no idea how to eat it. Laughing, we sheepishly pleaded ignorance to our server, who responded with a wide smile and a very INTIMATE demonstration. She tore a piece off of the flat bread, called injera, and used it to scoop up several of the stewed veggetable mixtures on our platter. Without skipping a beat, she had my head back, mouth open and was placing that morsel of goodness right into my pie hole. I kid you not. And WHAT a morsel! After seeing what a kick we got out of this, she repeated the process with my friend, with good humour and with the efficent, no-nonsense manner of your own Auntie. We couldn't have hoped for a more entertaining first bite of Ethiopian. 

Everything on the platter was delicious: there were two portions of a spicy spread, a warm spinach mixture, stewed lentils, something similar to warm curried hummus, and a tasty garlicy salad in the middle. It was PLENTY of food for two, and we both left stuffed and happy (especially after we paid; two beers and the platter came to around $25!)

He assigned me to my personal trainer Cody, who has been a Godsend over the last 6 months. Yesterday I went in to find out that Blake had been transferred. WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU THINKING??? He IS EoS Fitness. I have never walked through that door without him calling me by my name and checking on my progress. You can't have this incredibly awesome person at your gym and have him develop crucial relationships with your customers and then TAKE HIM AWAY!!! Don't you realize that he motivates us? He inspires us? He is there to give us advice? On top of all that, I know he loves what he does because I have seen him with several other customers and he is always a bundle of energy. I am crushed, sad, and very disappointed in your decision. I need to know who I need to speak to to get Blake back where he belongs- at ALIANTE!!!",0,WMAYlCQQCZGBSV8ymZgoAQ

I use the word 'famous' because they are heavily embellished with awards even from the Thai Royal government and had serviced big screen celebrities like Jackie Chan, Jessica Alba and the list goes on. Head chef Sasi was an iron chef winner and is celebrity status herself.

With such an adorned list of accomplishments, we arrived ready to culinarily enlighten. Once you walk up the stairs into the restaurant, the place has an old antique feeling to it like a mashup of a Thai temple and a traditional diner. A little worn but lots of traditional flair.

Their menu had a lot going on as it was so wordy that it was a little hard to navigate through. We decided to place our full trust in our servers recommendations and ordered the most popular items:

- Tom yum soup: this was the most sour Tom yum I have ever had. The sourness was so overpowering that it was hard for me to enjoy any other flavour that accompanied it.
- Divine crispy morning glory: battered thai spinach, it was fried similar to tempura style with a nice sweet and sour glaze. I thoroughly enjoyed this and would recommend.
- Sasi's red curry chicken with lychee: served in a pineapple and had lychee in the curry, interesting concept but can't say I was a fan. The taste was a little bland and it didn't have a strong flavour profile. The chicken meat was also slightly overcooked. 
- Sasi's pad Thai: the noodles were nice and chewy and it was a solid pad thai but again there wasn't a distinctiveness that would make me want to get it again.

Overall, it was still a satisfying meal and I wouldn't go as far to say this is a tourist trap because I'm sure Sasi is a super talented and great chef. However, our actual experience with the food here dulled in comparison to the glowing expectations of celebrity chef resto.",8,C3aIEUOx-vrHAeGVDnMAjg

There was a pickup truck in front of me on the line and it literally wasn't moved for 10 minutes. The owner of the vehicle wasn't around or sitting in the car. So basically the employees at Alamo were in charge of moving this vehicle. Literally 10 minutes later, they finally moved the truck through the tunnel and then I was able to go through the tunnel also.  The girl who dried my car did a real crappy job. There were lots of streaks on the bumper and the side mirrors had water spots. Unfortunately, I will not be returning here even if I was given a free wash.

Very misleading Groupon that states Hobe Prime Beef. What that means is that you HAVE to buy the prime beef to use the Groupon. After they mark up the Prime your Groupn is worthless and the owner was very unaccommodating about using it for what I actually came in to buy.

With a heavy heart I must write that I will no longer be a Patron of Bowl of Pho.

Recently, the restaurant has been sold and is now not even a cheap Facsimile of the Former.   Over my last four visits out of dozens, yes I gave it four last chances, the protein portions in their Pho has become quite miniscule.  On my second last visit I asked the girl working the front counter if the place had been sold.  She replied yes, and said she was the new owner and why I asked.  I told that it seemed like her portions have gotten quite small and she said there had been no changes.  I asked her if I can have more meat and she begrudgingly did so.  Today I visited, giving my close to home friend one more chance.  Low and behold, I got my bowl of Pho, and the same portions.  I actually took out the meat and took a picture. Four or five pieces of sliced meatball, four pieces of meat, and a tiny portion of tripe.  During my latest visit to Superior Pho downtown, I took a picture of their Pho, you be the judge.  I know another issue with my fellow Yelpers is the ridiculously small amount of Siracha they provide. It keeps getting smaller and smaller. Today the owner was out and the manager on duty couldn't even open the cash register to give me change.  This man has been working there since day one, and can't even be trusted with the register.

Thats no biggie but you'll notice when you walk in this place is tiny. Where you order your food is only a few feet from the tables and the cooking area is only a couple feet from where you make your order. This all isn't a big deal but on this particular night it was. It was in the low 80's outside but it felt like it was in the 90's inside. They decided to not turn the AC on and they just left the two main doors wide open. I was cooking after just a few minutes waiting for our food. But I'm sure once we get into summer they'll start using the AC(atleast I hope). One more thing, its very bright inside. I prefer a little darker place like Claim Jumpers. But that's really just personal preference.
  The two ladies working the register and bringing out the food were pretty nice. What I was disappointed in was instead od sitting down and being waited on you walked to the register and ordered from a huge sign on the back wall. They did have menus but we felt rushed making our order. 
  My son got the large basket of fries and it was huge! About as big as three large fries at Mickie d's . And it was only $2.99. My wife got the cheeseburger with fries. She gave me a bite and I have to say it was good. It was very rare though so you might have to tell them how you want it. Very bloody and pink in the middle. Fortunately I like it that way. My daughter got the kids pizza and she seemed to like it. I got the fish and chips for $12.99 and was pretty disappointed. Luckily it came with tartar sauce so that really saved it. The fish has absolutely no taste. If I didn't have the tartar sauce I would've been pissed. Comparing it to Red Robins Arctic Cod Fish and Chips it doesn't come close. Red Robins fish is so good you don't need tartar sauce and you get bottomless fries all for $11.99. You can even get the Red's Nantucket Seafood Scatter and get the fish and bottomless fries with fried clams for $13.99. Plus it all tastes great. If your just getting a hamburger or one of their wraps/subs there pretty reasonably priced but when you get into their seafood dinners their very expensive and I would recommend going someplace else.

I never received a response back and this was about 6 weeks ago. I will be seeing a dermatologist about my discolored forehead from the burn.

I ordered take out one time and I physically saw my food sitting there, while he was in the kitchen looking for whatever he was looking.  15 minutes later he still doesn't hand me my food.  15 minutes later he hands me my food and it was missing the pancakes.  So we wait another 15 minutes for the pancakes to come out and at this point i've been waiting 45 minutes.  When i got home the food was already cold.

I feed them a certain food, that's a higher end food, and I found this place as a vender. SO...I went. When I was living in Texas, as well as Florida, I found multiple stores that carried this bag for $87-$96 for a 25 pound bag. I figured I would be in the ballpark. I also needed some toys, so bam here we go. 

The first time I walked in, I wasn't greeted, and I literally did a full lap, no one said a word from start to finish. I passed 2 separate employees, and literally not a peep. So I didn't buy a thing, and walked out. Let's go to the next visit..Morgan helped me, was attentive, and amazing! What an asset! Anyways, that is the only reason this isn't a 1 star. So let's get to the details. 

The food I usually buy, and have for years was literally $130...I've been buying this in multiple cities and states for years, and have bought between $87-$96 a bag....the toys which I buy on amazon for $5-$7....$17-$23 in this store. It is INSANELY overpriced. Offensively...Morgan was kind enough to do a price match, and that's amazing, but she couldn't do the same for anything else but the food...So, for now on, I will be purchasing online, and I suggest you do as well, unless you want to overpay and have to show the staff how ridiculous it is so they can price match. How about instead of price matching, you offer the food, and everything else, at what the market charges?",2,zvycSYezB4a4fI3VPQ5Q2Q

vjAbS4qS6CmutM8mdebH4g,0,2018-10-30 00:53:04,0,8RkUQC5pdl6inSEe9dcO3w,2,"I have long debated on how to write this review for Beteena because all of her other reviews are so good. I went to Beteena BECAUSE of all of the amazing reviews I found online. However, my experience could not have been further from what other women experienced and I felt it was important to write an honest review.

My wedding was Oct. 19th and I took my dress to Beteena mid August. At my first meeting with her, after she stared me up and down for a few minutes she said to me, ""You need to lose 5 pounds, 8 would be better."" (as an aside, I am a usual size 8-10 and my wedding dress was a size 16). She also went on to tell me that the material of my dress was practically impossible to work on and asked me how much it was because she also took that into consideration when deciding her pricing. In addition to losing weight she told me that ""it was such a shame that I spent so much money on a dress that didn't have the seams tacked down and wasn't complete"", (side note - the dress was finished and didn't have the seams tacked down intentionally). After her assessment, she told me she was going to have to take the straps in, create the bustle, and hem it - all for $750. Not really knowing what seamstresses usually charge, I assumed that was normal. Price aside, I left her store in tears, feeling pretty shitty about my self and actually hating my dress because of what she said. Fast forward 5 weeks, I lose 10 pounds, and I am back at Beteena's store excited to see how the dress fits after following her instructions. I put on the dress and walk out to show Beteena and she says (in her extremely cold tone) ""Yes, looks much better, but it's still not right. Loosing weight didn't help much."" 

So she pinned the dress where it needed to be pinned - all the while complaining about the material and how hard it was going to be to sew and not sure if she could complete it. After she finished pinning, I walked into the dressing room to change. When I walked out Beteena comes back over and tells me that since there is SO much more work to be done since I lost weight (which she told me to do) the new cost to alter the dress was going to be $1,170. It is important to point out here that there is not a stitch of lace or one bead on my dress. I now have less than a month to my wedding and I start crying in the middle of her store and say, ""no, I am not paying that."" She then tries to explain why it costs so much and tells me that ""yes, I am much more expensive than everyone else because I pay such close attention to detail."" She then continues to tell me there was nothing that could be done based on the material of my dress and she wasn't even sure she would be able to complete it even if I did pay her and she wasn't sure if anyone would be able to alter the dress (not something you want to hear 3 weeks from your wedding after already spending $2000+ on a gown). 

I leave Beteena's store in tears for the second time, absolutely hating my dress and panicked. Which, yes, seems dramatic, but if you are planning a wedding you will understand why I was crying when you get to 3 weeks out. I start asking friends for recommendations for other seamstresses and someone gives me the name and number of Peggy. 

To wrap up this long review, I went to see Peggy (who laughed out loud when I told her what Beteena was charging me) and she saved my dress. I will forever be grateful to her. Peggy met with me three days after I left Beteena's store in tears. After I tried the dress on for her she said, ""Okay, this should be easy. I'll have it done in a week and it will be $125."" Peggy did a PERFECT job for $1,000+ less than what Beteena was going to charge. 

To say the least, my experience with Beteena was not great. To Beteena's credit, when I went to pick up my dress after I stormed out of her store in tears she did ask how she could have handled the situation better and was remorseful when I explained how offended I was by her and how terrible she made me feel. I do not think that Beteena is a bad person or a bad seamstress but I would not recommend her based on my experience.",0,t8ZIagvc_lUDnJ5ZVpnO7Q

This dealership used me to negotiate a better deal for themselves on a vehicle they already agreed to sell to me. Big waste of my time.

I even offered to make a down payment by phone (which was refused).  I was under the impression I was going there to sign the paperwork and pick-up the vehicle.  When I arrived, they were showing the vehicle to someone else.  I asked what that was about and how did it affect me.  The sales person said, ""no worries, we already have a deal"".  Then the sales manager told him to take me for a test drive.  When we came back, I was escorted to a sales booth where I sat and watched through the glass as they signed a deal next to me for the vehicle I was there to purchase.  I finally left the booth and asked what was going on.  At that point, I was told they were sorry.  Really?  Sorry we wasted your whole day on the phone, sorry you didn't get the deal we agreed upon, sorry we have no concept of professional behavior, sorry we used you to get a better deal for ourselves, sorry we acted as if your business means nothing...oh and sorry you are a woman, because maybe we would have treated you with some respect!  Well, you are sorry that is just great.  Remember how you treat your customers is everything.  I have never been treated this poorly at any business.

I think everyone was having the same problem because I watched some people get up and go to the bar to order their own drinks or chase down their waitress. Perhaps they were understaffed that day or they just had a bunch of retards working! The food was slow but good. I had the fried chicked and my wife had the fish taco plate. Both were cooked to our liking - even though they came to our table on the slow boat!

I'm sure the service problems were just a one time thing so we'll be back again for another review! I hope they can get back to 5 stars because I really enjoy this place when everything is working as intended!",0,Vth2iRVJE6rnovR2OcdNog

On my first visit, I stopped by the office and requested a test drive on a few of the cars.  They asked me for a copy of my drivers license.  Once they made a copy, they handed me dealer plates and asked me which cars I wanted to test drive.  I identified them and then they had a runner bring them out for me to drive....by myself!  Yes, I put the dealer plate on the dashboard, jumped behind the wheel and took off by myself to test drive the cars....keep in mind, these were not cheap cars...LOL  

I couldn't believe it!  They trusted me....I was actually very nervous and was more careful than normal.

I don't get this place. Given how they advertise themselves on IG, I came in here thinking this was more of a bakery with a few drinks here and there. But nope, it's apparently the other way around. Cafe 86 is more of a boba/coffee shop with a few pastries. I don't know about you guys, but I came here to try their pastries.. and 2 out of the 3 times I have gone there, they barely had anything left. If you're going to heavily advertise your pastries everywhere on social media, maybe you should focus on having them readily available.

First visit, they had no pastries available.. and we came around 3pm. Since we were already there, we decided to go ahead and try a drink. I asked the cashier what she recommended, and she said that the Ube Monster was popular - so thats what I ordered. I guess it's supposed to be like a Ube and Cookies&Cream milkshake. I hated it. It had very little Ube flavor and just tasted like milk. The cookies weren't even throughout the whole drink. All they did was put some cookies at the bottom of the cup, and on top. Pretty lame. Super disappointing and do not recommend. 

2nd visit, they had only ube truffles available.. and we came around 5pm. We also did the Yelp check-in for a free Hibiscus Cooler. The ube truffle had good ube flavor, but the texture wasn't to my liking. My toddler ended up eating it all though. The Hibiscus Cooler was pretty terrible - it literally tasted like water. Another disappointing visit.

3rd and final visit, we came in around 11am and was finally able to try the Ube Leche Flan Cupcakes. We also ordered the Mermaid Drink with Boba (Sea Salt Green Tea), an Ube Truffle, and got the free Hibiscus Cooler again (hoping it wouldn't be watery like last time). Was super excited to try the cupcakes, since that was what this place is known for.. but was pretty let down. The cupcake was hard and dense! I felt like I was eating play-doh or something. I'm sorry, but that's not how a cupcake should be. The only saving grace was the flan, but even that was just okay. We ended up just eating the flan and tossing the ""cupcakes"" away. Both drinks we got tasted watered down yet again, and the boba had no flavor. Yet another disappointing visit.

Also, what is up with the the theme of this place? It's all over the place. It's like they just took everything they like and threw it all together, even though it makes no sense at all. Star Wars, cars, Filipino sun, mermaid drink, _____ monster drinks, zebra drink? It doesn't make sense.

Cafe 86 is just all hype. It's sad, because I love me some good pastries. Such a shame!

TL;DR - They seldom have the pastries available that they widely advertise. Pastries are not as great as everyone makes it seem, and the drinks are just bad. 

Tip: If you want their pastries, go right when they open. If you want drinks, go to Brew Tea Bar.",7,sDjxEhVVwvVYFYv1rOFUfA

The pasta was overcooked and flavorless. They stacked the caesar salad with chicken we ordered in with the other hot food in our carry out bag so when we arrived home (just 7 min away), the salad was hot and completely wilted.

We were seated as soon as we arrived.  And, someone was at the door to greet us and check on our table as soon as we entered.  We sat inside, so not sure how comfortable it is to sit outside...maybe next time.  My daughter tried the kid's chicken strips and liked them.  I finished her last few bites and thought they were very good.  The rest of us tried burgers, which were all big and very tasty....and cooked to perfection.  We all loved the fries and thought the onion rings were good as well.  My wife and son had a strawberry shake for dessert and liked it enough to get one again.  Probably the biggest surprise after reading some other reviews was the service....which was spot on!  Our server (Eyan) took very good care of us and did a great job.  Fast to take our order, kept our drinks re-filled and came around just enough not to be too bothersome but to be there when we needed something.

Now that we know the trick (to call ahead), we'll definitely be back after having a really good meal.  For the size and quality of the food, I think the value is right in line with other restaurants.  It's not a fast food burger, so don't expect to pay fast food prices...cost is right in line with the quality.  Much better experience than the first time.

If you don't mind mingling with the junkies and homeless, then this is the place for you.

If I wanted recliner seats in the past, I always went to Galaxy but even then I stopped due to the inconvenience of its location.

Overall nothing much seems to have changed, but the seats are now reserve seating and with the recliner seats, make sure you bring a jacket/blanket because it's definitely pretty cool in there. 

So if you don't want to worry about lines and seating for midnight releases/Thursday night opening showings, this is definitely a great option. Regular evening showings are $10.75 (check for student discounts) and weekend GA is $11.25.

The waitress arrived with 2 egg rolls but we told her not to bother to go back to the kitchen for the remaining order.  Glad we did because the egg rolls tasted stale as though they sat around for a week and were reheated for serving.  The dipping sauce was a spicy chili sauce and it was terrific, especially in offsetting the stale flavor of the egg rolls.  The main course of honey chicken itself was tender and had no grizzle.  However the dish lacked any flavor whatsoever.  There was a sparing amount of glaze on the plate which accompanied the chicken but it too didn't add much taste to the dish.  I wouldn't order the egg rolls and the honey chicken again.  The big surprise was the brown rice.  It was awesome.  It was tender and cooked to perfection.

Now for the late night food:  They have free pop corn and pizza all night.  Let me say again.  Free: Pizza and popcorn.

I used to love this restaurant because the portions were large, generous amount of meat & rich flavouring. Unfortunately it is not the case anymore. Portions are small (I could finish it at one sitting...normally I need to bring half home). I ordered the Pollo Pesto & they  have since eliminated the cream sauce from before.  You must ask for it ( what?!). Even when u ask for it, the cream sauce is all watered down. Honestly...I could have made this at home.

They are probably advertising this as the new healthy approach. However, if I have to pay close to $20 for a small pasta it's just not worth the time. Stay home & cook it or go somewhere else.

The chicken itself was very tender, juicy, and the skin was crispy. 

The only problem I had was that the chicken is not seasoned at all. I would love to come back here again, but I would really hope that the chicken had some flavour in it. It just seems like the chicken is breaded and then 'broasted' and then served. Not being seasoned once.

The man running the operation is a very nice guy, he talked to me while he was preparing the chicken (which is cooked to order) and overall his restaurant is very clean. 

A little too clean though, when I went inside the restaurant I got an overwhelming scent of bleach. Not that it affects the food, but if I had decided to stay and dine in the restaurant it would've become bothersome.

We ordered the calamari, some kind of sandwich and spinach artichoke dip. The calamari tasted soooo gooood, spinach artichoke dip was really good, and I dont remember much about the sandwich but I'm sure it was fine. 

We came here saturday night too, also after a long night out.

Everything was pretty good from what I can remember. I think we ordered maybe 7 dishes in total and the bill came out to 100 something dollars.

If you do go there, I'd say get calamari for sure because its really delicious (cant go wrong with fried stuff). Spinach artichoke dip was also really good but I think its usually good no matter where you get it. Chicken and waffle (one big waffle) were just eh.

Lunch specials for about $5.65 and dinner specials for about $8 and up.  The dinner combo includes soup, egg roll, two fried shrimp, veggie fried rice and the entree of your choice.  I prefer less food but have tastier food.  Too much of bad is just bad, but a little bit of good is excellent.  
Here's why my star allocation is the way it is:
1.  Egg drop soup which comes with the Dinner combination had very little taste.  It is about 4 ounces but considering it is free, some consumers would appreciate it.  I would rather have no soup than tasteless soup.
2.  The free fried shrimp which come with the dinner combo were 70% crust.  Shrimp not cleaned. Found a long string of poop when I opened it.  A bit oily too.  See photos.  
3.  My House chow mein which came with Fried rice did not have much flavor. A few drops of sesame oil would have done the trick.  I added soy sauce to make it taste better.  If you see the photo, it looks delightful but it is a disappointment to the taste.
4.  Hubby LOVED his Orange chicken.  It was thinly sliced chicken and lightly crusted.  They should have followed suit on the shrimp and they would have been perfect.  Had brown rice with it for 50 cents extra.  
5.  Egg roll was pretty good.  Lots of veggies and not too greasy until you get to the end of the egg roll but that is to be expected.

My companion and I (always) order the vegetarian platter, which was $18. We asked the owner/manager if it's $18/person (a popular way Ethiopian restaurants seem to charge for their dishes) and he said it's meant to fill one person, but we may as well order 1 and see if we would be full. We were not. The platter is enough for 1.5 people(person?). The owner noticed we were not quite ""satisfied"" and when my friend asked if we could get another bowl of the sides, the owner gave it to us on the house. Now this is how you do business!! With the extra side, I had a very satisfactory and filling meal. So (you know what I'm going to say next), the service here was exceptional, including the waiter and waitress.

Food wise, the injera (which is gluten free) was very delicious in terms of flavour and texture. Also no upset stomach yay! The sides were not oily but was not as flavourful as I would have liked. Their best side in the veggie platter was probably their beets and this one side (that I cannot figure out what it is from the taste/appearance) that leaves a bitter after taste but is quite flavourful. The other sides were meh--again, not enough flavour.

Overall, food is a 3.5 (especially for the high price point), but the generosity of the owner and service from the wait staff moves them up to a 4.",3,v-R38AMN2ZZgr_iszlgc_Q

(No fault of theirs, I moved across town) however, I can't even tell you if the food was still as good as it was when this was my favorite restaurant. We were ignored by the hostess for 5 minutes after waking in, even though the manager had time to greet his friends but not assist his hostess. When we were seated, we waited another 6 minutes (I know precisely because I was already irritated with waiting and started my stopwatch on my phone bc I was curious how this was going to go). Finally a busser brought menus, 3 more minutes and the server change over and asked if we wanted water. Not drinks, water. At this point we were not sure if we even wanted to stay, it was that long between contact with our server and his return. It was a little busy, but he managed to attend tables on both sides of us and still walk by us without a word. When the busser tried to bring us bottled water when we had asked for tap, we sent it back and another 5 minutes elapsed as we waited for someone to come, rectify the situation or even acknowledge our existence. Finally fed up, we simply walked out. The hostess wished us a good night as though she had no idea that she had just seated us 15 minutes before. I was thoroughly disappointed. I brought my fiance thinking we might come here for our reception. Turned out that the service wasnt good enough for dinner, much less good enough for our wedding day.

There were about 15 people eating there. No one was at the front and it took them 5 minute to notice us and another 10 for someone to come over and take our order. Our server introduced herself as NOT our server. Bizarre. It didn't seem that busy. I wanted to ask where our actual server was. Didn't matter, none of my business
We just put in an order for egg rolls as an appy and 2 steals.  1 med and 1 med rare. 

The egg rolls came on top of shredded lettuce that were  old and brown. But since the lettuce wasn't why we ordered it, we just ate the rolls. Our steaks came 37 minutes later (I timed it with my phone) and not only were they Medium well, they were also BURNT. 

It doesn't make any sense to me that it took them that long to grill steaks on a none-busy night and have them come out less than acceptable. If it weren't for my side order of gravy, I wouldn't have even been able to eat it. Pretty much had to pay $80 for nonexistent service, mediocre appy and potentially cancerous meat. 

We usually don't complain about service or food but on the same night, I started to have an upset stomach which kept me up all night and my boyfriend had the same thing happen the next morning and throughout the day.

I had been in that store more times than I can count on two hands.  I did receive a full refund for all the inconvenience.  However, my debit card got hit over $200 after I returned the phones.

I paid approximately $60 for all-you-can-eat weekend brunch, without booze. As much as I love a good mimosa, I didn't want to fill up on liquid. We were here for food and we meant business. 
Reasons why I felt I got the full value of that $60 meal:
1. I went for the seafood first. You know that stuff is expensive and it is much less common in my life than some white or red meat. This means King crab legs, Cajun shrimp and grits, green mussels, lobster bisque, lox bagel  and lobster eggs benedict. Yes, I did eat all that.
2. The dishes are constantly being replaced with other dishes. I walked around 3/4 of the buffet every time I got another plate because where there was oatmeal and grits, there is now biscuits and gravy. Keep your eyes open and make sure to grab the things you really want before they're gone (they'll probably come back again but will you have space in your stomach by then? Doubtful).
3. Fancy cheeses and charcuterie! I made myself a personal plate that would cost at least $20 as an appetizer anywhere. Just take a slice of each. Remember, this is a marathon, not a sprint. Oh and they had fresh honey and jams too! My cheese plate round was FANCY.
4. If you do have enough room to eat some more after you hit the best stuff, go for the classics. I got a slice of prime rib, huevos rancheros, Mac & cheese, and fried chicken. Again, take small pieces because you're going to want to try it all!

Two things I will say that go beyond how delicious the food was: I wish one alcoholic beverage was included. No I don't want bottomless mimosas for $15 but yes I would like one. Cheers. Second comment is the crepe line was hella long and only got longer. We were lucky and got in before the major crowds come (the difference between 10:50am and 11am, folks). Only one person makes crepes on two burners. Each takes a good minute or two. Do the math, it's going to be a wait. If you want a crepe, even for later, go if there isn't too much of a line. Or don't go at all. They looked really good but I wasn't willing to wait ~20 minutes.

Overall, delish. I'm very happy with my six rounds of food and wouldn't change a thing (except to get ONE mimosa if they ever decide to offer that).",2,8ahrzebmEdp8NASJom9Izw

The bread is very good, worth every penny.  It is consistent, baked fresh, and has just enough variety to keep most people satisfied (although I could live with more variety).  The sweets are also very good; in my opinion the best item sold here are the almost danishes...they taste like a danish with marzipan in the middle, and are absolutely wonderful.

This cafe also serves food and can be a good place to get lunch.  The soups are consistently excellent, and the sandwiches (on the bread of course) are always good.

The atmosphere is nice, slightly trendy/urban; there is a clean tile floor, neat chairs, stools, and tables; very good jazz is usually playing.  It's not exactly a cozy place, it has more of a ""sophisticated"" feel to it; a bit more fast-paced and less laid-back, but very nice.  One can chat with friends or enjoy a cup of tea while watching the street--a very active place in the heart of the Cedar/Lee business district.

As the other reviewer pointed out, there is not a single place in the Cleveland area that resembles this one.  As such, it is greatly appreciated and is always quite busy.

My friends and I stopped here after dinner one night and did so out of the blue because we were curious to see what it was like.

The decor was amazing, I love how you feel like you are outside in a New Orleans street at night, as it got darker the little lights in the ceiling painted like a sky-scape began to twinkle.  The murals themselves are beautiful and whoever did them has a a wonderful talent.  New Orleans is eccentric and full of a rich cultural history and the murals, decorations and art are representative of that.

I think it's clever that everyone relates back to being outside in a New Orleans street, including the tables and chairs which are what you would find on an outdoor patio.  We started with four of their drink specialties including the Purple Haze, The Hurricane and Flirtin for a Hurtin.  All were tasty and made quite quickly.

While we were waiting, we decided to take their monster beer bong that resembles an octopus with eight legs.  It was hilarious and fun and gave us a chance to sample the incredible selection of Abita beer on tap.

We threw a couple bucks at the jukebox and played the music we wanted to hear and enjoyed the cocktails and atmosphere for about an hour.  Halfway through we decided to be adventurous and try some fresh oysters and the bartender happily shucked four fresh ones for us.  (He offered to serve them ""dirty"" for us, which means dropping it into a shot of vodka.) We decided to hold off on that experience for next time.

I thought the bartenders were helpful and nice and very accommodating.  We had a great time and I'm sure we'll try it again soon.",1,OKhg_0_bVI32wPgCY2INbQ

During the big names it can get a bit congested in there and potentially unsafe with the amount of people they cram inside. I typically choose to sit those out.
I really like seeing the yet-not-so-big-names! The crowd will usually be smaller and typically those artists will hang around to meet and greet... AND you get to learn about someone before they become a huge name and may never come back to a small stage...

There are several bars from front to back, and during bigger shows they'll pull out the standalone beer tubs ... so you're never too far away from another ice cold beer! Speaking of beer, they don't have any fancy craft beer - just your standard beer choices. But, hey.. it's perty durn cheap!! ONE TIP: BARS ARE CASH ONLY! BRING CASH. They do offer ATM useage which does come with a $2 dollar fee to pull out some more Jacksons.

Now, I've had pizza in Italy and Cibo isn't as good as that, however, it is some of the best I've had since Italy and was reminiscent of what I've had there. We came here on Wednesday night and the patio was packed and since we were pretty hungry we decided to not wait and just sit inside. I gotta say, it's a very cute place. I loved the decor, it felt very quaint and homey. The service wasn't the greatest, as our waiter was rather short with us and not too friendly.  The dessert did take a long time to get to us, but really we weren't too bothered by these things as the overall experience was a positive one.

Now, down to the good stuff... the food. My Husband and I shared a margherita pizza and a spicy salami white pizza. The margherita was to die for and the spicy salami was great with a nice kick. My favorite part of their pizza is the crust. It's is so flavorful and has great chewy and crispy texture. My sister had the special gnocchi, which was really good too. At the end we all shared the nutella and marscapone crepe, which was utter bliss.

Myself and 5 friends headed down to see what the fuss is all about. Everything about their menu is entertaining, take a look! They have a lot of options, many are gluten free, if that's your thing. They even have gluten free beer! (It's pretty good!) 

It's a small restaurant and you can only make reservations if you have at least 6 people. We grabbed seats at the bar overlooking the kitchen, a front seat to the action! Everyone was working hard as the orders in house and UberEATS piled up. It was a crazy night, but the wait for food wasn't too long. 

We ordered the Redneck. It came with 6 PBR, 12 sexy pieces of fried chicken, Taiwanese antipasto, choice of fried rice, naked bao with durty butter and tater slaw. It's a lot of food, but the perfect amount for 6 people. 

First up was the bao. Soft and fresh, this was my first time trying bao, but any bread product is a friend of mine. Next up was the Taiwanese antipasto. There were housemade pickles and other veggie delights. Good start!

My friends are spicy people, so our choice of rice was Red Rooster. It was a little spicier than I can handle, but everyone loved it. It had flavour and heat, a lot of spicy dishes don't get that combo, but this one was on point. The tater slaw was tasty. Not too much dressing to overpower the flavour of the crunchy veggies. 

Now for the main event, TFC! It was beautiful. Piled high and garnished to perfection, it was hot, fresh and ready to get on my plate. The batter was crisp and lightly seasoned. Not overly greasy, but not one of us picked the crunchy batter off. We were all fully impressed and full. 

The drinks! How to choose?! Their drink menu is equally as entertaining as their food menu. I chose the Silky Johnson. A sweet drink with vodka, muddled fruit, and flavours of peach and lemon. Amazing. 

For dessert we shared Ping Pong Beignets. Dough balls covered in sesame seeds fried and covered in sugar. I expected a Timbit like texture, but it was unique as they are made with yam and sweet potato. A must try! 

My second visit was equally delicious. I tried the OG Bao and Fingers of the Sea. I was also able to sample some You're Sizzlin Baby and Edamame Said Knock You Out. The OG Bao was ok, there was a lot more fat in it than I'd like, but the sauce was great and the cabbage gave it great texture. Fingers of the Sea wasn't what I expected. There did seem to be any batter, which was nice. The fish was a little sweet. The tartar sauce was perfect! The sizzling pork, arrived on a sizzling platter, was fantastic. Tender and peppery, it would be perfect on rice. The edamame wasn't special, but who doesn't love a little edamame?

The service was pretty good on both visits considering how busy it was on the weekend. All of our food and drink arrived in a reasonable amount of time. Can't complain since they were all nice and working hard. The décor is simple and functional with wooden furniture and walls. Great vibe!

I dont need some pimply-faced queen in training to be my YUM EXPERT (as he called himself) and try to explain how to build a treat.  I know what I want and I know the right portions of which topping grrrrrr!!!!!  The yogurt was pinch in the back of your mouth tart and the toppings (although plentiful) were all in different proportions as to what I would have preferred but since I didn't want to be in there for an hour explaining this to my YUM EXPERT I let him do it and of course it wasnt right and not worth the money.

First, this location is not open. She moved from Las Vegas to Henderson January 2017 and in 2018 she is moving to California. This review is for her Henderson location. 

Positives: DR Taherian was fantastic at quickly filling and setting up delivery of much needed scripts. She does listen to what I say and is empathetic to my limitations caused by my condition. When I needed a steroid shot her office staff got me in the same day and rarely do doctors offices actually follow through with calling a patient that is on the cancelation list but her staff did and I'm ever so grateful. Reception and nurses are always so very nice and helpful and the doctor is very punctual. Office was always clean and well organized. 

Negatives: the doctor however, I'm sorry to say that there are several negatives. 
- It took almost 3 months to get established as a new patient but that is typical for a Rheumatologist. 
-One months into my treatment I got a letter in the mail announcing that she was moving from Las Vegas to Henderson within a few weeks. I adjusted to the 45-90minute commute each way but was never please.
-She is one of those people that talks with her eyes closed. I don't know why people do that but it's rather unsettling when conversing with a doctor that won't open their eyes. 
-It took 3 calls in 2 hours to after-hours-emergency to the doctors answer service before she finally returned my call regard an emergency allergy to medication.
-When I asked what to do about my vomiting from medication, she said she couldn't do anything. I had to proactively ask for her to call out dissolving nausea medication. Rather annoyed it wasn't offered as temporary solution. 
-A separate time I called about an infection and was told she doesn't know anything about infections to that body location. I Should have been told to stop TNF medication until wound healed.
-Upon my last visit she told me that in less than a month she would be moving to California and her staff could give me a list of doctors I can call to try to get in and see instead, although it was not guaranteed they accepted my insurance or new patients.

Based on the location, lack of feeling I'm treated by a knowledgeable doctor and how she sprung moving on me twice, I'm not displeased that I'll be treated by a new Rheumatologist soon. I'll miss the excellent staff but not the doctors treatment.",4,-1x8gXJnrI-FeZPNvnfbRg

I drove by this place a few weeks back, and noticed it had changed from the schnitzel place that was there before.  I love Mexican food so I had to try it.  My buddy and I went there for lunch, on a Thursday. Place was busy, but not too busy which was nice.  Menu is simple, much like the rest of the restaurant.  

I had the burrito which was huge and delicious!  Food had a very authentic taste to it as the staff working there were all Latino.  It's the authentic taste that separates it from comparables like Mucho Burrito and Taco Del Mar.  They use fresh ingredients that's looks to be all made in house and you can taste the difference.  They also have a self serve salsa bar so you slather your meal with as much or as little of the different salsas as you like.

The only downside is that is is more expensive than the comparable burrito joints in town, with most menu items around 12-15 bucks.  But since its local and not a franchise I don't mind

Tears of joy that is.

You see, I used to live in AZ and would always frequent the ""old"" Goodwill north of this one on Scottsdale Road. So when visiting this past week, I asked my friend if we could go. She gave me the bad news that the old one had turned into a furniture only Goodwill but there was a new one.

I frowned as sometimes, I am not good with change.

But then we pulled up to this one and I could have sworn at one time Ty Pennington was there for Extreme Thrift Store Make Over Edition with people in the background screaming ""MOVE THAT BUS!!!!""

Why?

Because this Goodwill is frickin pimped out!

I was in sensory overload when I walked in thanks to the row upon rows of clothings, brick brack, books and more. Clothes were very organized and in order and after a few minutes of pawing around, I finally got a dressing room and everything fit. Can we say success? Yeah, the clothes seemed a little overpriced compared to other thrift stores I've been to around the country. But I guess when I get a compliment on my new-to-me Express top complete with all the rhinestones, I can say I got it in Scottsdale with an air of confidence.",2,l-tDF960t9BakjyH34XfTA

I ordered the filet and shrimp and the shrimp was like rubber. It tasted like it wasn't cooked all the way and it was very disappointing. The Filet was good but I've definitely had better from other places. They offer chicken fried rice for 2.50 extra and our chef drowned it in soy sauce so it almost looked like soup when he put it in the bowl. Everyone loves chicken fired rice and he just ruined it! 

The best part is when they toss the shrimp to see if you can catch it in your mouth. If your lucky enough you may get a shot and they give you free sake. 

I haven't tried the Kobe steak yet, it is super expensive unless you are out for a special occasion. A lot of other reviewers seem to like the sushi.

Of course, I was a bit skeptical, but after coming out of the show, I was completely blown away by all of his mind-reading tricks, predictions, and seemingly supernatural abilities.  I've been a big fan of magic for a while, but after Frederic's masterful performance, I gained a deep sense of admiration and respect for him and mentalism.  Why?  Because there are so many variables involved, there's a greater risk of failure or the illusion not working.  Somehow (probably through years of practice and dedication), he hit one homerun after another.  
 
I don't want to say too much about the mental feats that he pulls off, but there was one in particular that involved two audience members that utterly floored me.  As soon as it happened, I whispered, ""No way!""  Some audience members gasped in surprise and disbelief, while others sat in stunned silence.  My fiancé said that trick gave her goosebumps, and I reiterated her sentiments.
 
After the show, Frederic was kind enough to take photos with audience members and perform a quick trick for each person.  A total class act that made the experience even more memorable!
 
Nearly a week later, my fiancé and I still talk about the show, bewildered and amused as ever.  Another Yelp reviewer said that he enjoyed this more than David Copperfield, and I couldn't agree more.

What changed was the service. On my last visit it was reasonably attentive, despite the fact that I was dining in a large group. When I returned, everything seemed fine until we placed our order. The waiter brought my wine, and then disappeared. We literally did not see, speak to or hear from him again for the rest of our visit.

That meant that when my glass needed refilling, busboys had to be flagged down. When our dishes came and no parmesan cheese was offered, busboys had to be flagged down again. No one came by to ask us how our dishes were and if we needed anything else. When we wanted dessert and the check? A manager came and apologized to us, gave us our check (no comps offered, if you're wondering), then went on her merry way.

After being a LOYAL and FREQUENT customer for 4yrs it's sad to say I'll never do business with them again.  We have referred friends, family, co-workers, and for that matter strangers at the grocery store. 

There was a mix-up on a pizza order of ours. They had always left about 2 slices for us just cheese. (We have a toddler lol) But it came in all pepperoni. Not the end of the world, mistakes happen. We called to let them know and also mentioned they did not stamp our receipt  (for their ""loyalty"" program)  The manager expressed her apologies and offered us a free 12inch cheese and said she would double stamp our receipt the next time.

I went in to pick up an order on Christmas Eve and reminded the manager about our double stamps. To which she took such tone and demeanor towards me that I was uncomfortable. She proceeded to say she never promised that to us. And I asked her, what do you think that I am making this up?

At this point I'm near speechless because this lady ""knows"" me, she's seen me a million times, we've always been friendly.

She said ""Well I never told you we'd give you double stamps and we already gave you a cheese pizza JUST because you didn't get two slices of cheese on your order""

It was Christmas Eve. My feelings were totally hurt, never would I make up such a thing. Hey, I'm just the customer and was offered something by them for a mistake they made. I didn't ask for anything. If they offer something, honor it! Do not make someone feel guilty or uncomfortable about it! And surely don't say you didn't offer it when I know darn good and well that you did. She was so rude to me. I still can't believe it happened!

This place does not know how to manage time or appointments, and the customer service is impeccable. I scheduled a 12:30pm appointment for a gel manicure so I could run over on my lunch since my office is within walking distance. I was traveling out of town after work and did not have time to visit my regular nail salon so I figured I would give this place a chance.

I walked in 10 minutes early to find that there were only three people working. There were also three of us waiting, two of which seemed to have been waiting a long time by the time I walked in. After sitting there for 40 minutes, other people who walked in after all of us waiting were taken in before me, despite me having an appointment, and the others waiting. Once all three workers finished their clients, and took on new clients, I knew I would be in for an even longer wait, so I walked out. 

Never once did they acknowledge me, the fact that I scheduled an appointment, or that I had been waiting for over 40 minutes on my lunch break. When I told them to cancel my appointment because I could not wait any longer, they acted as if they had no clue what I was talking about and never once apologize. 

Time is money, and it is very disrespectful to not be cognizant of others time. I obviously will never be returning, and will ensure that all of the ladies in my office building do not waste there time.

I recently purchased a used shotgun from them that didn't work.  I took it out to the range, and it wouldn't fire.  When I took it back, they refused to refund my money.  They wanted to take the gun and fix it, but the point of me buying the shotgun locally is so that I can have it right now, when I want it.  The issue was with the firing pin, and they couldn't tell me how long it would take to fix.  They finally agreed to give me store credit to buy another gun, but they didn't have the one I wanted in stock.  Needless to say I still don't have a shotgun, because I have to wait for them to order me one.  The only thing that would have repaired this transaction would have been to return me my money so I could purchase the actual shotgun I want elsewhere.  If I wanted to order one and wait for it, I could have found it cheaper online, and had it shipped.  I'm frustrated with the process, and it will cause me to hesitate before buying from them again.

The prices are pretty high to me considering the beds you get. I got the package that gets me to the level 4 beds. The beds are ok - I got a good base tan going. 

I would say that the staff is just OK. A couple of the girls keep asking me if I want to go the full 12 minutes. Dude...look at me...I'm fair skinned and I don't want to burn. Don't they see the # of minutes I went last time on the computer screen?

We began with a delicious beet salad that included both cabbage and seasoned carrots followed shortly by varenki, Russian style dumplings generously filled with melt-in-your mouth potatoes and sour cream.  For an entree my wife ordered schnitzel, an Israeli style chicken fillet that had been rolled in panko and fried, adding a small house salad at a nominal cost. I chose beef stroganoff served in a cream and mushroom sauce.  Both entrees included a good sized portion of roasted young potatoes that were delicious.

Now put that cow tongue on my human tongue. Aw yis!

Anywho, let's cut the chitchat and jump right into the review.  Depending what you order, the portions can be either pretty generous or really skimpy.  Like the pork belly here are ridiculously tiny and extremely frozen.  This bacon comes to you ready to plank [y'all remember when planking was a thing?].  I didn't enjoy how a lot of the thicker cut items were frozen as it made the meat steam.  I want that char-grilled goodness!  The marinades and seasoning are definitely on the softer hand of things as well.  The Sesame Marinated Beef, Angus Prime Brisket, Beef Tongue, Octopus, and Marinated Beef Rib Finger Meat were decent.  Everything else was pretty basic.  The steamed egg is something you should try and the cheese corn is something you can pass on.  The meat quality is pretty average.

When our first round of goods got to the table, our server dumped all our entrees onto the grill and all I could think about was how that raw chicken was tainting my beef tongue.  Since tongue cooks up a lot faster than chicken, I cringed and made sure to overcook the heck out of the tongue to avoid salmonella.  Overcrowding the grill with five entrees also didn't help with the cooking.  Everything was just steaming by that point.  After the second round of food, we asked our server to just set the dishes down and let us grill it ourselves and at our own pace.  The service was pretty sparse and flagging our waitress down to order more food was a challenge as they were shorthand and it was quite busy.  There were long periods where we just sat around staring at our dirty grill [which we did have to call someone over to change] while either waiting for food, waiting for water refills, or waiting for our waitress to reappear so we can order more food.  Also, perhaps it was just our table, but our grill had some uneven heat going on.

This place also has the worst ventilation system.  We all know you'll end up getting smoky at KBBQ but this was like tear gas status.  It was insanely smoky and one of my friends had to step outside because she was starting to feel ill from all the smoke.  The smoke can literally be seen sitting in the air like Karl the Fog in San Francisco.  They kept their doors open to try and keep the place clear but it didn't really help and I can only imagine how much smoke will be trapped in that building come summertime when the doors are shut and the A/C is on. 

All in all, I don't think I'll be back.  Why settle when there are some great AYCE KBBQ places out there with much better service and product?  Also, if you do come here, I suggest bringing cash.  Splitting a check is a nightmare here.",89,zFYs8gSUYDvXkb6O7YkRkw

Most menu offerings are reasonably priced if you apply for their VIP discount card and taking into account the cleanliness of the place (it looks very clean) and the more upper scale decorations than many other Chinese restaurants, it's worth a return visit.  

We usually order staples such as the peking duck, as well as the salad and the tofu dish (large blocks of tofu cooked in some sort of delicious brown sauce).  The other dishes such as the sweet/sour fried pork cutlets and eggplant dish are good as well. 

There will be a line up when you arrive for dinner, so if you have a party of 5+ people, I recommend you calling ahead to reserve a table.

At this station premium was $.50 more per gallon than regular!! I've never seen such a huge difference between the lowest grade and highest, that's crazy!

We called a week ahead to put our 'name in' because our party was for 14 people and they don't technically take reservations.  I was glad to hear that they would put our group at the top of the list for our convenience and we wouldn't have to wait that long (Which was great because we had a baby and an elderly family member). When the Sunday morning came (10am) we arrived and we were greeted very warmly. How refreshing, a busy restaurant smiling and not freaking out due to the party size. The restaurant was bright and seemed rather casual. They seated us promptly (no waiting). There was a manager (I believe) that even took our cake we had back to the fridge so it didn't take up space and would be fresh ready to go after brunch. He was so nice! Now comes the food part. It took a long time for a waitress to come over and take our order. Which was odd, you would think with a party that big, the server wouldn't have that many other tables. The poor girl had 4 aside from us!! Poor thing. Although we were starving, when the waitress did finally take our order (15+ minutes), she was very pleasant. I could bet she was frazzled, but she didn't show it when she arrived at our table. So ordering wait time was not good, but once again, customer service was nice.  And after all, a good experience at a food restaurant is highly based on the staff. I ordered pancakes, turkey sausage, and scrambled eggs. All very good, but nothing was 'amazing' or 'had to have'. But was hot, had just the right amt. of seasoning. And the food arrived pretty quickly after ordering (normal for a large party size). Please note, they do have a menu for gluten free I believe. (One member of the party had to order special for their diet). Then the manager brought out the cake we brought and a bunch of plates (and 'to go boxes for the rest of the cake).Very nice indeed. After all was done, we had to split the bill unfortunately, so it created a bit of havoc when separating the bill. My sister had a coffee on her bill (and she didn't order one) and we had a whole meal added to our bill and we had to get that removed. The manager again stepped in and was very cordial and removed the item (after 15 min. of discussion with the waitress).

-  I told them I've only been to nail salon 2 times before that I know nothing about getting my nails done when I got there.
- I brought several photo of what I am going for.

- Sample color and actual color was VERY different. (Picked white, and somehow it turned to be lilac color)
- They asked me how do I like them, so I told them honestly that I didn't expect dip power would be so obvious and uneven that I don't really like it. She sounds frustrated at me, and workers and a regular customer started telling me that they like them.
- They suggested other color and it will be better and that'll be closer to what I want. I still tried on my thumb, but the color was so off from I'm going for, but at this point, I knew they can't deliver anything I'm looking for, so I gave up and told her to leave it. She said she can't just leave one color on so she is putting the first color back on.
- By the way, she made me bleed 3 times. 3rd one happened when she was fixing my thumb, and looking my nail right now, my blood stained in my nail because she did it so many times that she didn't deal with it properly on the last one.
- My co-worker told me about this place (but in different location) and dipping powder gel. Hers is amazing even though she also has lighter color. I was telling them about her nails and the lady says ""you should have told me. Take a photo of her nails next time!"" ......... tell you what? First of all I don't want the exact nail color, second, I showed them so many photos of what I like. I mentioned I need help picking colors because I don't have experience that I don't know how it turns. 
- The lady DID say that she didn't know how the color would turn on actual nails, and so as why the sample number and actual bottle number didn't match.

I know a lot of people loving this place, even customers I talked to while I was there were loving here. Not sure if the lady wasn't professional enough or not familiar with dip powder gels, or... I don't know. But stop frustrating at ME just because she painted completely different from what I asked for.

The Crepe is located in Tivoli Village on the ground floor next to Kidville and the Indoor Market. If you sneak a park near the elevator you'll pop right up next to it.

After reading some reviews and deciding to try something new in Tivoli, The Crepe was on the list of targets to try. I'll start by saying the Crepe is a fence sitter!!! Why you ask, well if you go by the reviews , this place is amazing 5 stars and others give it 2 stars. And I can see how it could be both. But I'll go by my experience if it helps.

So this business is kinda funky, it has a European decor that reminded me of a lot of places in Italy and France which I use to visit. All they needed was an espresso coffee bar and boom you got a train station cafe in Italy. Also a nice play area for the little ones is an added bonus.

Seating ourselves down, the first thing I noticed was the tables were a little small and the wooden chairs are super loud if you move them on the concrete floor. Our sever gave us the menus and ask if we wanted drinks to start. The table next to us was told about the specials which I we wish we heard. They only serve bottle still or sparkling water, kinda strange but ok. The sever bough 2 sizes of San pel and I asked for the small one but was only able to buy the big one, as the manager made a new rule.(weird)

As the crepes are nationality based we went with Thailand and Poland Crepes with kids american pbj with banana. All the crepes are built well and were extremely delicious. My Thailand was great with only a hint of spice to it. The kids crepe was pretty awesome as my son ate the whole thing.

During the days they have a fair amount of kids activities like sing along and story time. At night they have Latin music and a bit of dancing.

I like this place. It reminds me of time I spent in Europe, but I'm gonna give it only 3 stars. The service was ok. The food was actually pretty good. But for the price, I'm gonna have to say it ain't worth it. 2 adult crepes. 1 kids crepe and 3 drinks was over $50 with tip. I can see renting being high in Tivoli but maybe a more realistic price point this place could be a massive success .

Appetizers: Spring roll- I'm not a huge fan of spring rolls to begin with but my bf ordered. I thought the wrap was too thick, I'm big on texture and it felt weird. Wontons were probably the best dish, fried Foods can never go wrong. 

Main course: we both got pho, I had the well done brisket & steak pho which came with about 3 pieces of meat. I ordered more meat on the side which was a $2 up-charge.

Dessert: mango sticky rice is one of my fav desserts, sticky rice was good not the best quality and mangos were about to go bad, very mushy & flavor was almost tart.

It was a lot for her to pay out with such a limited income, but was so hopeful that it would work. After about the 3rd day her feet were worse and she was in worse shape than before she got this machine. So she called them and the woman told her to use it twice a day for 30 days and she should be good, so back on the machine she went and it got so bad that her feet were burning all day and all night, so called the office again, and the woman actually told her that if it is not working for her ""Maybe you better put it on Kijiji and try to sell it for $200.00 or whatever you can get for it as we do not do refunds""

*sigh*

I used to like Tao.  Used to.  Past tense.  
But the reprehensible and abysmal customer service we recently encountered on numerous fronts border on cataclysmic.

Ill Communication... (Beastie Boys, 1993)
10 days prior to Vegas, more than one person in our entourage attempted, valiantly and persistently to secure guest list accommodations, all to no avail, no recourse, no reply, no acknowledgment from Tao staff/management.  Fine... it happens.

The Tipping Point... (The Roots, 2004)
So, uncertain of our status on the guest list, we made a conscious effort to arrive early to stand in line, arrayed in a 16 girls to 6 guys ratio, the ladies looking delectably hot and the gents dapper smooth (or at least passable... meh!). For over an hour prior to opening, we stood there (at the front of the line), as did countless others behind us, until a security/bouncer announced, ""regrettably"" of course, that they had over booked the guest lists and no general admission guests would get in.  Hmmph...  Frustrating and a ridiculous, considering those guest-lists were in circulation all night and some idea that they were over-booked should have been evident much much sooner.  But fine... that kind of thing happens too, I suppose...

By All Means Necessary... (Boogie Down Productions, 1988)
At this point, KT, in her most tactful and professional demeanor (... and a vivaciously flattering top...), set out to see what could be done.  We were told to go ahead and just get in the guest-list line.  Then told we weren't on the guest-lists.  Then directed to speak with ""that guy""... who told us to talk to ""this guy""... who said to KT, ""Sorry, there's nothing I can do, try another club"".  Wow, really?

Stakes is High... (De La Soul, 1996)
During the horrific menagerie outside, three friends, assured we would get in, threw down the $grand for table/bottle service and were awaiting our arrival inside.  Aghast that we were turned away, they negotiated for 7 of us (5 girls, 2 guys) to get in; the other half our crew had gotten in by just walking up to the counter as-if they were on the guest-lists (Bum Rush The Show... Public Enemy, 1987).  As it would turn out, another doorman would demand that we purchase another bottle @ $300 for the admission.  Hmmmm, really?  Your bottle service, as it were, allots 3 guests per bottle and there were only three people inside with three bottles.  Ludicrous.

Tougher Than Leather... (Run DMC, 1988)
So, we walked away... no club is worth that much stress, drama, and runaround.

Yeah, I used to like Tao... USED TO.

EvQZDyoTT2ztVdw6rH3EwA,0,2012-07-28 11:29:19,1,WjJtQEyICdN4WTFgwdhzRA,1,"let me detail my last experience:

I called network automotive on Main St. in mesa for a quote for replacing a part on my vehicle.  I had done my own diagnosis and was confident that the problem would be remedied with this procedure.  On this call they took down the information and said they would call me back with a quote.  They did return my call later that day and left a message saying to give them a call back.

I called them back the next day and received a quote that seemed reasonable given the labor rate, and the price that I could find the part for.  I made an appointment for the next day at 8:00 am.  I was under them impression that the part was already ordered considering I was a return customer, and I had an appointment set. 

I arrived right at 8am to have the procedure done.  I handed my keys to the person at the desk and proceeded to wait.  What I saw happen next was that my truck was pulled into the back corner angled away from me, the hood put up, and not one person went near my vehicle for an hour and a half.  At around 9:30 I asked them if I should bring it back at a more convenient time.  They said they receieved the wrong part from the parts supplier.  I just looked at the person expecting him to tell me the correct part was on the way and he didn't; rather, he asked, and I quote, ""why do you want to replace that part?  I've never had to replace that part before.""  I must remind you that on the first phone call I explained to them exactly what I wanted to have replaced and why.  At this time I explained to him exactly what I had already explained twice already, on the phone.  After I finish he tells me that he can only find the part I need for over 3.5 times the price that I could find it for from Autozone.  As this is all happening the tech has finally decided to pull out the old part, and he comes walking in to the desk area with it, and he says, ""yeah, it's bad.""  This made me think that it took about 2 minutes to get the part out.

All in all, I ended up paying 90% MORE than what they originally quoted me, I paid 125% extra for the part, and paid for 1.5 hours of labor, for a 15 minute job.  I was there right at 8, and was able to roll out at 10:50.

In conclusion I will never take my vehicle back there.  My vehicle is over 10 years old and I maintain it very well, as it is an essential part of my livelyhood.  It's unfortunate that we cannot count on a local business such as this one to take care of the people from the town where they do business.

I see a lot of people that give rave reviews over their alignments, and I'm sure they probably do a good job, but if you need parts, prepare to get GOUGED.",4,ddnOxfqf7FPSFL2lOwOlIw

We had the lasagne which was burned, cold and with ingredients that don't go with it. The spaghetti carbonara had a strange taste. The gnocchi were warmed up and not fresh at all.

It's been a fun ride, and I wanted to do something different that most Yelpers wouldn't do. As the owners know, I've been writing reviews every month to accurately reflect how a tenant's stay is here on a regular, recorded basis. Gables did NOT pay me to do this, there was never an agreement, it was just something I decided I wanted to do when I first moved in here.

OK, so now with that disclaimer out of the way... Here's the monthly breakdown summary. 

June 2016 -- 5/5
Honeymoon phase. Moved into a B2 unit. ATTACHED garage is a HUGE plus. Very spacious closets, the ""his and hers"" walk-in closet is a neat idea. Spacious kitchen, spacious bedrooms, space architecture is well designed. You can thank Mark Taylor for that when they built this place (property now managed by Gables). Pool is awesome, music plays until 10 pm at the pool. Gym is open 24/7. Yoga on certain days. Business center is open 24/7. I have gone in there to do work when COX fails in my apartment (because COX is crap, but I digress...)

July 2016: -- 3/5
Wow, that $500 energy bill. Look, I get that this is Phoenix and I also get that Gables has no control over the energy company, but what Gables DOES have some limited say in is the facility infrastructure. The buildings here just don't hold air conditioning very well.

August 2016 -- 3/5
Still a high energy bill. Also had my son during this month, so imagine the panic I had when the AC broke down. Luckily maintenance was here within hours, but during that time I pulled the trigger on buying a portable AC... Which brought down the energy bill but meant that my son & I were quarantined to two rooms.

September 2016 -- 4/5
Phew, that energy bill went back down. I tried the grille for the first time. LOVED it. Maintenance does a good job cleaning up not just the grilles but the surrounding grass. Let's be real, any apartment you go to, dog owners are terrible at picking up their doggie doo. This is not a problem isolated to Desert Club. People are assholes. Also, the people that slam the garbage door outside the master bedroom at unit 1137. Luckily, maintenance found a creative way to reduce the noise output when one closes the door. This is when I begin to realize that Gables is pretty on top of their game.

October 2016 -- 5/5
I turned 27, but with a son, you don't really go out to party. Had a drink at home, and experienced mosquitoes outside. Like another reviewer pointed out, in the B2 unit, you can't really get natural air ventilation in the living room, cuz the only source of natural air is a french door with no screen... Mosquitoes everywhere! Gables did a great job with pest control spraying down the property perimeter, proper good job to the staff!

November 2016 -- 5/5
I quit working for Sprouts and began working for Amazon.com. I am so sorry, Gables for all the increased number of packages that came in from Amazon.com under Unit 1137. You have done a fine job entering in all those email notifications sent to us for each package that came in. I just checked Amazon.com, I ordered close to 100 packages at this point in the lease. No idea how you did it but you did.

December 2016 -- 5/5
More packages! Gables found a lost dog and did the right thing emailing the community asking who the dog owner was. Not sure if they ever found the owner, I hope they did. Kudos to Gables. Also, holiday party with lots of different dinner entree and even dessert options, unless I'm remembering incorrectly now... It's been too long now.

January 2017 -- 5/5
Trump is now President but Gables is still awesome. Packages from Amazon.com continue to come in. Gables hosted a brunch! Also, fitness center got fix flooring. Further proof that Gables is awesome in their upkeep and maintenance. New gym looks awesome. Also, 24/7 gym still since day 1.

February 2017 -- 5/5
Gables hosted brunch on a Sunday! That was pretty cool to see residents from different buildings come together for some coffee and doughnuts and bagels. Also they had painters come out to freshen up the exterior look, so that was neat.

March 2017 -- 4/5
Some service requests got put in for some broken lights. Gables jumped all over it, and resolved the issue via mitigation, so that was cool. Also new pedestrian gates got installed in the community, so that was neat.

April 2017 -- 5/5
BBQ! Nothing else needs to be said.

May 2017 -- 5/5
Here I am!

OTHER STUFF:
Like other reviewers have stated, the facility infrastructure is dated, so this impacts tenants primarily in two ways: high energy bills in the hottest months of the year in Phoenix, and noisy floors when neighbors above you are stomping on their floors. Fire alarms go off when you use the oven (other tenants have stated), 

All in all I enjoyed my stay here despite some shortcomings. Some things are not correctable here no matter how great Gables is, but overall I still recommend living here even with the higher rent of N. Phoenix!",6,TaVuQWmXAhxy_LvIXBs9sg

A day or so later I noticed the watch receipt indicated a black strap; however it was a real dark brown strap. I called Peter and asked him to correct the strap color on the receipt if it wasn't too late. During our conversation I casually mentioned I preferred a lighter brown strap than what is on the watch since it can be confused with black and my preference is brown straps.  

A few weeks later I received a phone call informing me the watch is available for pick-up. Much to my delight and surprise they had switched the strap to a much more complimentary lighter shade of brown. Wow, what can I say......except, Shazam!",0,YTtaAnHMsXozVB29qr3sbA

I was out to dinner with 2 friends & after reading the reviews this place relieved, it sounded fantastic. After the first round of orders the quality of the service & sushi went down drastically. The server let us sit for 15min after taking our plates from the first order before returning to take our follow up orders. When the 2nd order had been placed, our server returned 10min later & rudely questioned if we could even finish our order. This led to another 10min wait before receiving our food. I understand having to serve & accommodate other orders/customers, but the delivery of our food was a slow & drawn out process, especially when compared to the super quick food drops when we first sat down. Sushi that was supposed to be hot was cold, & the cold sushi was warm as if it had been sitting out. At this point we knew we were no longer wanted. After flagging down our server, we requested dessert along with the bill. The mochi was on point, but the tempura ice cream was presented in a soggy condition, ending our evening at this establishment. All of this & they had the nerve to ask for a 12% percent gratuity on the check. They treated us horribly as customers.

While it is certainly overpriced, that just fits in with its Summerlin location as many restaurants are overpriced....you have to know that going in.  So considering the food is great, the only reason this place is 3 stars is because of its atmosphere.  It is not cozy, not quiet, not relaxing.  There are no booths for secluded conversation in its big open dining room.  There are no nooks to settle into.  The music is loud and annoying when you are trying to have a nice meal with friends/family.  Overall, this place is too open and too loud.  And I am not saying this as an 'old, crotchety' person.  We are in our 30s.  In retrospect, we should have sat outside.  In fact, we skipped dessert just to get out of there.  I live around the corner, but not sure I'll be coming back.

My quick tips:
-Great for groups, and for more of a ""dining"" type Chinese buffet experience. 
-Food-wise not the best in its class but still decent; and you can't beat the décor or service (again, versus its competitors that I know of)
-If going with a group, you can ask for separate bills, they are happy to accommodate and are quick.
-At lunchtime, go early, it gets very crowded by noon.

***note: sorry, this is my first review, I should have maybe read the others' before writing this so I apologize in advance for repetition on some items.

Ok, here are my thoughts:
Some background - hadn't visited the website or heard any feedback when I first entered this restaurant. Needless to say I was both surprised and impressed by the magnificent décor. I am not aware of any other Chinese buffet (let alone an authentic one) with any noteworthy décor. I feel this is the restaurant's selling point, over its food so please note I've written more about this than the food itself.

All dark wood, dark (ambient?) lighting. Interesting heavy heavy carved furniture. Seating options for larger groups include long medieval-feeling tables with end chairs looking like throne chairs - super tall backs (fun to hang your jacket on the back and have it high above you); or large oval communal-style dining, all chairs with tall chairback. Medium-sized groups can sit in bench booths, or much more fun - you can sit in a wooden boat, surrounded by blue tiles emulating water. 2-4 parties can sit at round tables (with folding leaves to accommodate more plates and table clutter) or smaller two-seater tables. All seats provide great views of the magnificent dining room. I should note there is a smaller, more modern and bright room as well but the two times I came to this restaurant they were not in use.

Other noteworthy décor notes: 
-there are giant red ornate chandeliers everywhere, bringing together kitsch, recent chandelier trends, but also the Asian love of red. 
-bronze heads of all the Chinese astrological signs great you upon entry.
-strangely, there are glass cabinets displaying jewellery for sale in multiple locations.
-upon entry, you will see large (volleyball-sized) round flour-based and deep-fried balls. These presumably are symbolic for the dragon ""pearl"". It's pretty fascinating to watch staff creating these marvellous wonder in a wok covered in glass for protection from sputtering oil. There are also pieces of broken up balls you can sample on that same counter. They taste like oily sweet cracker chips.

On to the food!

The only contenders I am aware of in similar category are China Buffet King and Starwalk. I won't even count Mandarin (yuck) or anything similar. For me, Both CBK and Starwalk have far superior variety generally speaking. Like its peers, Dragon Pearl has sections for cold salad appetizers, soups, bbq, hot foods, fried foods, dessert, waffle, ice cream. I feel these are similar to peers, but not as good. 

A noteworthy station however is the small easy-to-miss noodle station located by the edible ""pearls"". These are hand-pulled noodles. They are similar to Udon but less chewy. You can choose a broth of either chicken broth, szechuan beef, or chicken something else (a thicker and more flavourful version of the basic chicken broth. These can be topped with green onions and coriander. I've tried the latter two, both excellent. Both times I asked for ridiculous amounts of coriander (I'm an addict) which may have been why I loved these so much but the flavours and textures really were fantastic.

Tea also set this place apart. I ordered Iron Goddess Tea and it was served in a clear glass teapot atop a tea warmer (tealight candle inside). Very much enjoyed having warm tea for the entire meal, and as a plus was fairly good quality tea as well! Far superior over the low-quality versions of Jasmine or Oolong served by its peers.

I wasn't tired after my meal which I usually am after Chinese buffet. Perhaps less/no MSG? 

The meal was polished off with our server bringing us hot towels to wash our hands, and a pile fortune cookies, nice way to end a meal.",6,7eoEh0yu3Pt67nSFASw3ZA

It was cold in parts, tasteless overall, and super salty on top. Our friends got the bangers and mash and the short ribs. Both were edible, but nothing you would ever go back for. I was completely underwhelmed and ended up needing to get room service later on because I was hungry since dinner was so bad.  The service was bad, too. Super slow even though there were enough servers for the few tables that were occupied and it felt like the waitress just didn't care.

I was in Scottdale for business, and the local hotel recommended Italian Grotto for dinner.  We called ahead to see if we can make a reservation, they told us there aren't any reservations available, but the walk-in wait time is only 10 minutes.

Upon arriving (5 minute drive), the front desk person told us it would be at least a 30 minutes wait.  Fine, maybe a few large parties decided to show up between the time we called and when we arrived.  After 30 minutes, we were finally seated.

After being seated, we waited another 15 minutes for a waiter to stop by with water.  It took another 10 minutes for him to come back with the water and the menu for us to order.  By then, we have waited for a good 30 minutes before putting in our orders.  

We ordered fried calamari and zucchini, spaghetti w/ meatballs, sausage and peppers, and the shrimp scampi.  The waiter somehow messed up our order where our entree came out first without any appetizers.  After 10 minutes, we asked about the waiter to cancel the appetizers as we were already finishing our entrees.  The waiter said he would check, but came back with our appetizers 10 minutes afterwards.

To summarize our experience:

Good:
1. Great location, in the heart of old town

Bad:
1. Poor management - misjudged/misspoke wait-time just to get more business
2. Slow Waiters - it takes him at least 10 minutes to come back to our tables.  Took over 30 minutes to put in order despite us asking to order
3. Bad waiter attitude - even after making the mistake of not putting in our appetizer, the waiter would not own up and cancel our order.  Came back 10 minutes afterwards with our appetizers when we already finished our entrees
4. Mediocre food - everything was extra salty

Overall, would not recommend anyone coming here.  So many other places to go with better service and food.",1,DAVCgu4FxtBc-5-eD3GwGg

Specifically, I was craving the bacon wrapped dates and sangria. I was so disappointed when I heard about the health code issues at the Henderson location, so I was happy to see that this location was good to go. 

We ordered a plethora of dishes, all of which were very delicious! However, they are so overpriced that it was hard to make sure the small party I was with got even a taste of each dish. Some of the small dishes had only 2 pieces! For $10-ish dollars, I think that's a bit ridiculous. I simply couldn't afford to eat here with more than one or two people, because that adds up quickly. 

I love the interior of this restaurant. It is a pleasant place to be! I especially love the patio, although it was closed the last time I was there. 

Overall, this would be a good restaurant for a date, but, in my and my wallets opinion, not so great for a party of multiple people because you would need multiple plates of the same item. The bacon covered dates and sangria are must haves.",1,TXo4TyFJrCbwl4mJsHDUzg

Let's start with the poppyseed bun...just doesn't get better than that. My hubby and I each ordered multiple dogs - so I was able to sample his as well.

The Chicago is *gasp* just as good as if you were in Chicago. The Chihuahua is like if a hot dog and a taco got married - yum! The Mac'N'Cheese dog weighs 20 pounds but is worth it just for the delicious mac. The Cuban is everything you love about Cubans but in hot dog form. The Angry Tiki was my favorite: pineapple, bacon, hoison, and Double Dip sauce - um, yes please! 

I'm not a huge fan of the deep-fried/double-fried french fries but they were at least fresh and piping hot. Also, there are plenty of options for kids to eat. Plus, to keep everyone occupied while you wait, there's coloring sheets and TVs everywhere.

The beer menu at D's is just as satisfying, with every type and pour size you could imagine. I'm pretty picky with my beers but had no problem finding more than a few that I wanted; and, my hubby is an IPA aficionado and was over the moon to find a Triple on the board.

One downside to D's are that it is pretty small on the bar side - and a there's a long wait on the restaurant side. It is also extremely loud and can get warm when it's packed. 

The only other con, which is more of a symptom of our voluntary gluttony, is you will leave feeling uncomfortably full :)

I had a reservation, made through Open Table, for a party of 4. Two people arrived early and were seated right away. When I arrived, a drink menu was promptly delivered...actually it was an iPad but same thing, and our drink were ordered. The atmosphere was loud in a Saturday night kind of way. Unfortunatley, two of our dinning companions were a bit older and hearing was an issue for them. I suspected this might be a problem, as Tapas restarants normally promote drinking and plate sharing which leads to lots of guest interaction. But I just went with it. 

We ordered the Tuna raspberry skewers, the spicy tuna cones, a serrano ham plate, truffle risotto, a salmon dish, galic chicken, and artichokes. I woudl say 50% was delicios, the other 50% was just meh. The artichokes were little grease bites, the salmon was forgettable and the raspberry tuna skewers looked better than they tasted. My favorite was the spicy tuna cone. It had great texture and the flavors worked really well. The serrano ham plate was simple and everyone gobbled it up. The risotto wasn't the best i've ever had but the truffle flavor was intense and I'm a sucker for truffle anything. 

Dessert: Churros with chocolate dipping sauce & Almond cake. The churros were hot but plain, no sugar or cinnimon sprinked on them. The chocolate sauce was thick and slightly spiced with chili, yum. I prefered the almond cake. It was simple and a nice finish to the meal but nothing I would specifically recommend to a visitor. 

Drinks- I have an obsession with Aviations and the one here was really good. Not a great as the ones made at the Vesper Bar but still very tasty. They also had a nice wine list but the waiters knowledge was not that extensive to be able to make suggestions without pouring multiple tastes.

The beer selection was terrible; I had set the bar higher since it was an Irish pub. They had all the usual suspects, Guinness(I guess that counts) and no local beer.

I got the Fish & Chips and Dad went with Bangers & Mash. He said his was good, but the portion was a little smaller than he expected. My fish had thick batter and the fries were blah.

On my first visit, the staff were very nice and walked us through the menu and explained what arepas were etc. I think it's GREAT how the restaurant takes time to explain to customers what their speciality is, and what the dish is made out of. Sometimes, customers that are new to a certain type of ethnic cuisine have no clue what to order, or what dishes are famous for that region. ::high-five to you Barroco Grill!!::

Food: For appetizers, get the empanadas! If you love potatoes like me, you will enjoy this dish a lot!! Marinated beef and potatoes in pockets of fried deliciousness- yes, please! You must order an arepa as well! I got the chicken one this time around, which was good. I think next visit I'll have to get it with some chorizo, mmmh. The portions are also fairly big, so it's hard to leave hungry...unless you are a big hungry bear in disguise. I also tried the cheesy corn, which was a bit too heavy for me. But if you are in the mood for something rich and filling, and you love cheese and corn, this dish is perfect for you! Also, you must try their four different house made sauces. My favorite is the pineapple, because you can actually taste pineapple in it...and it's not some watery pineapple flavoring liquid. The saltiness of the chips, and the sweetness of the pineapple is great!

I rolled in with one eye open after spending 3 hours at the Art Museum and was on the border of passing out from a combination of exhaustion and starvation.  I was seated immediately and greeted by my server.  The decor here is pretty rustic, with huge planks of wood sticking out of the wall, giving it a cabin feel to the place.

I scoured the menu and couldn't decide what to get.  Part of the reason I rounded down is because I wasn't really impressed with their menu selection. I had a hard time deciding what to get, and finally went with a burger and fries.  Also, they only have home made pop here, nothing name brand.  (no coke or pepsi on tap.)

Even though the food was good, I LOVED my server.  She rocked it out and I really enjoyed her company.  I guess she's been there a long time, and I would go back just to sit in her section.  Don't get me wrong, the food was good, but I was much happier with the service I received.

However, this time on 11/3/12 I went in there around 1 AM and the service was not that great. We asked for lemon with our water and didn't get it, we asked again and we still didn't get it, and then on the third time we finally got them, but we were out of water by this point. Also, when the food was received, we didn't even have any silverware setups. In addition, instead of my usual french toast, I ordered the brownie sundae. Now I love desert, and try the brownie sundae in nearly every restaurant I go in, this was by far the most horrible brownie sundae I've ever tasted. While the brownie was warm, it was dry and tasted stale. When I took my first bite, it tasted like I was eating a spoon of powder. I don't know if it was just an old brownie or what, but it was not good. Also the completely drenched it in hot fudge and whip cream. I don't know if this was to mask the horrible brownie, but it was a sad attempt. I told the waiter who's name I'll withhold that I didn't want it anymore, and his response was just ""well, I can't take it off the bill"". Usually not tipping is a sin to me, but this service and food just didn't deserve one. When I went to pay at the register the manager is who rung me up, and he was a little more apologetic at least. The sad thing is, we brought a guest from out of town to this restaurant to show him some awesome food & service, but came away disappointed and embarrassed, as the pancakes he ordered ended up having avocado/guacamole on the bottom of them, making him lose his appetite.

Took them almost 3 minutes to even realize I was at the register. The cashier, didn't get her name but our receipt says ""Alex"" was her name. Anyways, I asked her about what type of chicken they put in the tortellini and it seemed to inconvenience her that she had to turn around and ask her manager. My boyfriend ordered a simple turkey, egg and cheese sandwich plain. They gave us a sandwich with turkey, lettuce, tomato, and no egg. When we tried to get them to re make it, they were very rude about it and it took them another 15, almost 20 minutes to get us our new sandwich. Then the second sandwich they gave us was wrong again! They put egg and sausage on a bagel? Nothing near what we ordered in the first place! At that point we had been waiting almost 40 minutes for a breakfast sandwich and gotten 2 wrong sandwiches and terrible service. When we spoke to the manager on duty about it he just shrugged his shoulders and said ""well that's how it's made"". We were furious and ended up leaving without even getting a third sandwich. Ridiculously ran business and we will NEVER be back. I advise you to go ANYWHERE ELSE.

A year later, this extremely successfully sushi joint was sold to someone else and the glory days were over. Another year later, a place called Charlie's Lunch Box opened in a different plaza - the cheap sushi and lunch bentos were a hit and about a year or two later, the place was sold and the glory again ended.

Fast forward 4 years later, this rumoured same owner opened a place in Toronto named CJs lunchbox - also cheap sushi, but I was pretty disappointed. Yes the sushi is cheap - about $4 per roll, all pre-made and placed in little boxes at the front. The prices are good for what you get, but the experience was just not the same anymore.  The menu is very small (no spicy mayonniase) and miso soup now cost $1. Did Mr. Charlie sell this place again?",0,HyXK2GNR9i4SWpLQGOqQYQ

While we were looking over our menus we overheard a server commenting on the pumpkin cheesecake being house-made and amazing.  It got my hopes up that everything else would have been house made as well. 
I ordered the gnocchi, and my boyfriend ordered the chicken parm. They both had the same sauce- which tasted like a can of tomato sauce with garlic powder and dried oregano sprinkled in before being served. Canned tomato products definitely have a distinct, awful taste so that was unfortunate.  The Gnocchi was stuffed with a spinach ricotta mix. They were kind of gummy, and were all extremely uniform.  
The chicken was breaded with Italian-seasoned breadcrumbs, and was more soggy than crisp. 
My boyfriend did like the bread they served before the entrees, it was like thickly rolled out pizza crust dough, brushed with butter and Italian seasonings, then cut into strips.  Our server poured a ton of oil and vinegar on a plate to go with it, I was surprised she used so much until I tasted it. It tastes like they either cut it with vegetable oil, or use an extremely low grade olive oil. The balsamic vinegar was very sweet and thin.

Leaving behind all of my car friends and connections back home in Chicago was difficult, because it's hard to find quality people in the car community. However that wasn't the case when I took my first trip to Static Motorsports to see what they were all about.

       Amongst arriving to their location, I noticed a lot of very well put together cars outside (all with Static stickers on them) so I knew I was going to enjoy what I was walking in to. When I opened the door I was greeted by a friendly lady named Tannah. She showed me around and gave me all of the information necessary to get a full understanding on what Static does on the day to day basis. After talking with her I was introduced to her fiancé Anthony. Anthony is the guy who puts in all the hard work and dedication to get the job done correctly. He makes sure everything is up to par after Tannah does all of the inspection down to the smallest detail. He gave me a quick run down on how the wrapping process goes. To say the least, these guys at Static Motorsports make it look easy.

            I've been meeting more and more people from Static since that day. One employee Mark who's young but very skilled and qualified for his years, walked me through the process of doing the interior trim. I was mind blown, if I wouldn't have seen it with my own eyes, I would've thought it came like that from the factory. The staff here at Static Motorsports is by far one of the greatest groups of people you could ever meet. I have yet to see one person leave there unsatisfied with a huge smile on their face. I'm glad to now think of them as a family to me. If I could give this more stars I would any day. Do not hesitate to go here for your car needs or advice!

My gf and I decided to sit down and try it anyway even though we wouldn't be able to order from the full menu. We were hungry and in the mood for sushi. 

Garlic edamame - oily and bland; didn't think edamame was a hard dish to execute, but I guess it can be for some $7 

1 piece of tako nigiri - 1 piece for $5. Nothing special. Tasted like typical tako nigiri. Again.. 1 frickn piece. 

Salt and pepper shrimp - this dish was tasty; shrimp was cooked nicely and had a nice crisp to it - $14

Tuna tataki - delicious; most places never go wrong with this dish; made with ponzu sauce $15

Westside Roll - this roll had different ingredients, but was tasty as well; surprising ingredients included Asian pear and a peanut curry sauce $18 for 6 pieces.... Seriously 6 pieces 

The food overall was for the most part tasty, but honestly the prices are not worth the portions. I realize this restaurant is on the strip, but really for a more reasonable price you can get tasty sushi many other places in Vegas. The ambiance was unique and the restaurant has a cool vibe. 

Also, being that we were one of two parties in the restaurant at the time, service was pretty slow. I also realize this restaurant just opened and perhaps the are still getting things situated and organized, but management who have their shit together usually translate into staff having their shit together. 

Being from Hawaii I've eaten a lot of sushi and although most of the dishes were tasty, the prices were a bit steep in my opinion.

You should be experienced to deal with different types of hair, the hairdresser I had seemed like she was fresh out of school and had no clue how to blow dry and style. This isn't my first time in this location and the last new times I have been at this location my hair hasn't met my expectations. 

I arrived early and the hairstylist was late, so I waited outside until they arrived. I understand that happens but come on it's the Shangri-La,. On this day I also brought my sister who was scheduled to also get her hair done same day. I have curly, thick hair and let the girl know this on the phone and upon arrival, curly hair (a.k.a. you need to work the brush in to my hair) She blow-dried my hair with no style, had no clue how to manage it and thought that a ""light"" mist of hair spray would keep everything in place... ""light mist"" really??? 
 
By the time I got home (10 min bus ride) whatever looked like a style was gone and I was mins away from going to an event. Not my first time at this location as I always bring my sisters with me to get our hair done at the same time. I sent them an email to let them know that I was unhappy and have never heard back. That lets me know that the location isn't managed by people who care about their clients (maybe this has changed since, however my mind hasn't.)

I remember the prices were so reasonable, we ended up ordering one of everything off the happy hour menu just to taste the tapas.  I think we were 95% happy with everything we tried.
Last night I met a friend of mine there to watch flamenco dancing which they have on a stage on Thurs, Fri, and Sat. nights.
I ordered a vodka and tonic and the bartender asked me as an afterthought if I wanted lime.  I said yes and he proceeded to bring me 3 in a glass cup.  But the limes looked old and dried up.  Small detail I know.  He shoulda thrown the lime slice in my drink then I would never have known!
Then I asked for olives which he proceeded to bring to me wrapped up in a cocktail napkin . . . for such a nice place, I think he could have brought it to me in a glass!
When the restaurant is nice, in a prime location, I expect the standards to be a little higher.  Tapas Papa Frita is not a dive bar!

I got the regular sized combo platter based on suggestions. The combo platter comes with chicken , beef , rice , lettuce , tomatoes and pita. The meat (especially the chicken) and the rice was dry but the white sauce helps make it more bearable. The reason for the 2 star rating is because there was nothing really special about the food. My 3 other friends who dined in with me also got the combo platter and said the same thing too. It's eatable , but nothing really stands out or makes you really want to come back. At least it's affordable and portion size was good - I paid around 10$ for my meal and saved the other half for dinner.

For you spice lovers , get the red sauce but beware it is spicy. TRY A LITTLE BIT BEFORE YOU PUT IT ON YOUR FOOD. I would say it is spicier than habanero and closer towards ghost pepper spicy but not all the way that spicy. I put waaay too much red sauce on mine and my lips swelled up for a good hour. I also went on a day when the A/C was broken and it was super humid in there. I still wonder to this day how I even ate half of my food at that time.

I found this place and am absolutely floored that Yelp let me down!  This wasn't a case of the kitchen having an off night.  I am honestly surprised that people enjoy any food coming from this place.

As we came here for wings, it was the first item on the menu I looked at.  There are 8 different flavors to choose from, but don't expect to ask for a sample.  Our waitress immediately stated that we couldn't sample any of the flavors without a $.50 per sauce surcharge.  When asked how hot, I was told they use Frank's Red Hot for their base.  Authentic and Original it ain't.  Portion size is either single or double, which is code for 10 (bone-in) or 20 wings.

I ordered Bone-In and my friends got Bone-less and Chicken Cajun Sliders.  The wings were typical frozen chicken.  The Bone-less were frozen breaded fare I could get from any grocery freezer.  They were dry and bland.  The sauce was definitely heavy on Red Hot, making this one wing experience you can safely skip.  The bone-in wings were average size, and not something I would expect at a buck a piece.  

The sliders were dry.  The chicken was dry.  The cheese was dry.  The sauce was not a help.  There are only 3 sliders on a plate.  And everything was plated with a HEFTY dose of French's fried onions.  I am not sure why, because they certainly weren't tasty, and added nothing to the meal.  Even the wings came on a bed of french fried onions.

You would think the atmosphere would have made up for the terrible food.  There are a ton of TVs and Big Screens, perfect for sports fans.  Plenty of comfortable tables, and 3 outdoor patios.  A large bar takes up most of the West side of the building.  But somehow, we were let down again.  During an obviously big game night, we waited 40 minutes for a table when there were a DOZEN open tables all evening.  There was enough people to fill the restaurant, but obviously mgmt wasn't able to staff the establishment properly.  As a consequence, it took almost 30 minutes to get our food order in.  Food did come promptly, but when  you are dumping frozen food into a fryer, this should be a no-brainer.

Pretzel cone: 

The little bit of extra salt you get from the pretzel cone def adds to the flavor of the buttered pecan. That, I liked. When I got down to eating the cone... I wasn't as happy. It's harder/more condensed, not as light/crispy as an actual pretzel. I'm guessing they may have to make them this way to withstand the ice cream, but I didn't like it. I ended up breaking the cone apart with my hand to get the rest of the ice cream, then throwing it away. If you've never had one, I'd still recommend trying it because my wife thought it was great. It just wasn't my thing. I would go with my old friend Waffle cone next time. 

The Ice Cream:

Just as their name implies, the ice cream tastes like the old skool, made with a hand cranked, wood plank Churner type of ice cream. So good. Everything about it tasted natural and fresh. Their ice cream is spectacular.

Those darn Bloomin' Onions have me addicted!  Even with my love of Outback, it can't save this particular location for me.  This location just stinks!  

I went here with a girlfriend to celebrate her birthday.  This location is near her work and where she picked to go.  We went in for lunch during the week.  We walked in and it was almost empty, even though it was 12pm.  The host stand was staffed with a guy that resembled a robot.  He was just on auto-pilot and was there to do his job and nothing more.  He wasn't rude, but he wasn't friendly either. He was just there to collect a paycheck and nothing more.  A smile or a hello would have been nice, that's all I'm saying.

We were then seated at a table and waited several minutes before our server acknowledged us, even though there were only 2 other tables in the whole section.  Our server was friendly but ditzy.  He did bring out drinks out shortly after and then took our order.  We didn't see him again until we were half way though the meal. He did bring us out refills at this point, which was nice since we had been out of drinks for almost the whole meal by then.  Again he was super friendly, just an awful server.

Now for the food.  We order the new Barrier Reef Trio with the coconut shrimp, crab avocado stack, and ahi tuna and a steak.  The seafood trio is definitely an appetizer, unless you have a small appetite.  Luckily we had also ordered soup and salad as well, otherwise my friend would have starved.  The seafood was pretty good though except the coconut shrimp were about 5 seconds away from being burnt.  

The steak I ordered medium rare came out medium well.  Ugh, who even eats medium well steak?  Anyway, the steak was overcooked but my friend had to get back to work and we didn't have the time to send it back.  Since I was just going to eat it, I asked the other server (since I couldn't find ours) and the food runner if they could grab some blue cheese dressing (sounds weird but it goes so well with steak!).  They kept telling me ok, but no blue cheese ever came out.  I gave up and just ate the steak because of the lack of time.  I had also ordered the garlic mashed potatoes.  Even these were wrong.  They were so full of lumpy, half cooked potatoes.  I love potatoes, but not undercooked ones.

I am really not a complainer, but this whole experience was just bad.  I still love Outback, but I won't come back to this location, unless I absolutely have too.  So you can see the food was ugh, the service was blah, and the overall experience was just mediocre at best.  You have been warned about this location!",12,8DBH3BpLINfTAK_Up5BtUQ

For the past two months I have been bombarded with lease renewal letters but there's a reason I'm not signing them to continue paying $1300 a month for this. Figure it out

Update: It took 2 days for me to get a new keycard. Management was out of town and said they would not answer their phones or let anyone working onsite make a key. They never answered my emails and did not apologize at all. It is unbelievable that they do not have some protocol for situations like this or if an issue happens after normal business hours.",2,XLKczT2G20NRS-gbKi5Rpg

Once you enter the store, you are greeted by store associates. Everything is well layed out, with  department signs hanging from their respective ceiling spots.

Ross has a variety of home accessories, from kitchen, bathroom to the bedroom, and these items can be purchased for quite a discount from other stores that sell the similar  items.

I have never purchased clothing from Ross.  However, the clothing selection appears to be well stocked, and the shoe selection apoears plentiful as well. There is a jewelry department if you need some earings, watches or bracelets.

I visited this restaurant for the first time yesterday to use up a Groupon.  Thank God I didn't pay full price for this slop.  

First, lets talk about the decor.  Others have commented about the outdated 80s look of the place. I concur.  The chairs are ridiculously heavy and uncomfortable.  And don't even get me started on the hideous glass constructions hanging from the ceiling.  

Second, let talk about the staff.  Unprofessional to say the least.  When we were waiting for our table, I witnessed the hostess yell at a man from across the restaurant, instead of walking up to him and guiding him to his party.  ""Hey Anthony, your party's over here!""  Ridiculous. 

This restaurant has an open kitchen, which is usually a good thing - but not when everyone's yelling at each other.  We were seated near the kitchen and, I'm not exaggerating, heard someone yell ""order!"" approximately every 30 seconds.  Staff yelled at each other from across the restaurant constantly.  I felt like I was on a playground.  

Our waitress was a nice, sweet girl, and she did the best she could considering the environment she was in.  I have no complaints about her.  

The food, though... Jesus.  We started with the ""margarita shrimp cocktail"".  Imagine tiny round pieces of popcorn shrimp floating in a glass of lime flavored water.  These were served with tortilla chips, which you'd think were meant to be used to scoop up the shrimp from the glass.  But, the shrimp are solid round balls, not a scoopable salsa.  We tried picking up the shrimp with the chips, but they'd just roll off and end up on the floor.  My date and I just laughed as we TRIED to eat this concoction.  When it finally made it into our mouths, it was gross anyway.  

My boyfriend ordered a sushi/sashimi combo platter.  I'm being generous by giving it a rating of mediocre.  Take out sushi from a grocery store is better.  

Now, I admit, I made the mistake here - I ordered the fried fish platter.  I'm used to getting a variety at seafood restaurants.  At a place like Mitchell's Fish Market, you can get a dish with a piece of fish, a few scallops, a few shrimp, and a vegetable.  The Original Fish Market has no such dish.  The only dish I could get that had more than just one piece of fish with some plain steamed white rice and steamed spinach, was the fried fish platter.  So, I ordered that, with a side of green beans (vegetables were $5 - $7 extra).

The description said I would get a piece of tilapia, scallops, oysters, shrimp, and french fries.  I didn't realize this meant that the tilapia was fried, the scallops were fried, the oysters were fried, and the shrimp was fried, all on top of a giant bed of fried french fries.  It's just not what I pictured.  Like I said, it was my mistake for not reading carefully and not asking the waitress, but lets say for argument's sake that this is what I wanted.  

It was still disgusting.  The batter/flavor was exactly the same for everything.  The scallops tasted like the french fries.  The shrimp tasted like the french fries, the tilapia tasted like the french fries.  I didn't even try the oysters, but I'm pretty sure they would have tasted like french fries.  I ate barely a quarter of this dish, and I'm pretty sure I consumed an entire week's worth of saturated fat.  If you ate this entire plate, I think a heart attack would interrupt your dessert.

The green beans were good. 

Other people commented that you can't count on hotel restaurants being worthwhile.  I have to agree.  If everyone's just passing through, you don't have to worry about actually impressing anyone and getting them to come back.  And with business travelers, they're usually paying with their company's dime, so they don't bother to complain or expect much.

I have learned my lesson.  I'm not coming back.  And I seriously question the sanity of people who gave this place more than two stars.",0,Mphrvw1SuAn4dMGx95MGDg

Please bear in mind, my issues with this place stem from the fact we spent over $200/night here. I would have much rather spent that money to get a much nicer hotel (*cough*aria*cough). Had the hotel cost $100/night or less, my review would be much different.

My boyfriend and I went to Vegas with a large group for business/pleasure. The group decided on this hotel. Other friends of mine had warned me of how much they hated staying at SLS, but I figured they were exaggerating. After the weekend, I totally understand. 

Here's the thing (or many)... SLS is WAY off the strip. Think Stratosphere... You have to take a cab to go really anywhere, which is not my fav thing to do. Or you could take the train, but for me, no. 
When you get into SLS, it feels dark. The decor, design and actual lighting is dark. You think of walking into many of the nice casinos to at least a bright lobby. Not here. Also, what's with the monkeys everywhere? Don't get me wrong, the hotel is CLEAN and it is TRENDY, just not my style. Certain things about it feels...creepy. (see Photos)

We got to our floor and upon walking down the hallway, I was weirded out for real. The always are black with these Dr. Seuss feeling white grass things all the way down the hall. Dark carpet and mismatched numbers all willy nilly on the doors make you feel like you're in a dark themed fun house...not upscale, not relaxing. (see Photos)

Now, onto the room. Umm...again, the weird grassy paint with black, white and this super pale pink. What? Anyway, it felt so small and so CHEAP. I took many photos. You can just see for yourself. One small window with standard slat blinds (like at your grandma's house) and a pull down shade. So much light seeping thru the sides of the blind, not to mention the HEAT flowing in. GREAT..not getting that super dark hotel room sleep this weekend. Whatevs. Now...on the pull down shade is a photo of a crowd of people. Like their faces..over your head...on your bed. So weird. (see Photos)

The furniture in the room was so cheap. I felt like I might as well stayed at a Best Western dressed in alternative design. The table was an OCD nightmare (see Photo). The top of it was slightly off kilter, permanently. I kept wanting to move it! haha strange. The phone is on that table, across the room. There are two large mirrors on either side of the room, with lights bordering it. Kinda cool. Bright lights. The dresser/cabinet/closet piece was quite small and nearly pointless. It was taken up by mostly the mini bar. Who really touches that thing?? Anyway.... there are 4 medium sized drawers, one is filled with a safe. There are a few hangers to hang dresses/shirts. functional, but you have to look at it the whole time. You can't close away the closet, makes the room feel (again) cheap and messy. Can you tell I like my Vegas rooms to be neat, clean and relaxing? 

The bathroom was odd as well. Not much counter space to get ready (as a girl, you get it) so I had to do makeup and hair on the floor in front of the large mirror in the room. The bathroom felt like a senior citizen's bathroom. Railings everywhere. There was only a shower, no tub. The shower had a bunch of railings too, and a weird fold down seat. Super elderly. Also, the shower had no lip/divider to keep water from going across your floor. The first day, I made the mistake of leaving my clothes on the floor while showering.. soaking wet mess afterwards. The door is a sliding mirror door that doesn't lock and has a rather large crack/opening on the sides. So much so, you can see thru into the bathroom! Awkward. I have photos of all this, check it out. 

On to the restaurants and pool (I didn't play in the casino, so IDK about that). The choice of restaurants is slim. Coming from LA, they're all restaurants I can go to here in LA. Boring. I get it, SBE...but still. With SLS being so far from the rest of the strip, we ended up eating at these restaurants most of the time. Felt like majority of the restaurants were polar opposites. Either really casual ""inexpensive"" or super fine dining ""expensive"". Not much in the middle. 

The pool was decent (LUX pool). It wasn't ever super crowded, which I like. The drinks were okay. The food was normal. Music was good, not too loud, not too quiet. But the pool closes at 7pm! Before the sun even went down...okay... sure. 

Room service comes from the Northside Cafe in the casino. Good food, but you receive your room service in paper boxes, plastic ware, and no tray. So do yourself a favor and save the $15 in room service fees, just go order to-go from the restaurant yourself. Room service here is a JOKE. 

Overall, again, had this place cost us $100/night or less. I would let a lot of these things go. But knowing I could have stayed elsewhere, a place I know I LOVE for the same price, really bruises my bananas.",15,MAl4Fj9gKiSzo4Sec4eQcQ

May not be a big deal however there where chemical squirt bottles hanging over the ledge of the sink pointed towards the ice. Also not always using a scoop for the ice but dragging plastic water glass thru the ice to fill the glass. Perhaps a serve safe class should be in order.,0,L4GWsYhc9Y8kV726iUa_tA

I presented symptoms of what I thought to be an upper respiratory infection: facial pain, chills, low grade fever, aching throat, chest pain and wheezing while breathing. Went into this place and was seen within 40 minutes, and presented all of these symptoms to a doctor in residency. Was given an in office treatment of albuterol  via a nebulizer after a series of absurd questions regarding symptoms I didn't have. Bear in mind this was from the supervising doctor and not the doctor in residency, who actually attempted an examination. 

Doc: ""do you have asthma?"" 
Me: ""no""
Doc: ""are you sure?""
Me: ""still no""

After that treatment, which I admittedly didn't well to, I was asked about some other symptoms. At this point I wanted antibiotics, as this is usually what is prescribed for my frequent upper respiratory infections

Doc: ""are you coughing?"" 
Me: ""no""
Doc: ""we're going to give you some prescription cough suppressant"" 
Me: ""I don't have a cough; can I have some amoxicillin? That's usually what I get prescribed"" 
Doc, clearly annoyed: ""yeah sure but take the cough medicine"". 

Get to the pharmacy; low and behold, no antibiotics have been prescribed. This is day 6 with no symptom relief and nothing but cough suppressants for a cough I didn't have and continue not to have; turns out I have a sinus infections that can only be cured with....wait for it....amoxicillin! Jesus jet fuel Christ, if I had a broken rib would I be given medication for heart burn? Or if I had appendicitis, would you send me on my way with Advil and some juice? 

 Medicine should not be dictated on narrowed views of how medicine should be administered and gut feelings. 

I would not recommend this place, not because of waits, over charging, or any other of the complaints on Yelp; don't go here if you want care for the illness you have. My care was a series of random guesses based on symptoms I never presented (I still don't have asthma). I somewhat get the aversion to prescribing antibiotics , especially during flu season, but they were developed for a reason. To help you body get past an illness. If a medical professional won't help get you past your illness for what ever reason, then they have ceased being useful to you.",1,u0k0wmO399--zSv1nLnTXQ

The ribs seems more worth to eat in person and with company. With such good reviews, I thought that their other food items would reflect the taste quality of their best seller. I was sadly mistaken.

I ordered the braised beef soup udon and fried chicken wings. Blandest soup noodles I've ever had in my life. There was no flavour at all - I would have been at least satisfied if it was salty enough. You would think with all the ingredients in there it would have some taste. The chicken wings are the saving grace of the meal but not by much, the portion is a little smaller than I expected and it was pretty average tasting.

To be honest, I wouldn't bother leaving a review if the food tasted mediocre - I would just make a mental note not to order again. But I'm leaving this review because I do hope that the restaurant will not neglect the quality of the rest of their menu even though I'm sure the ribs are excellent. 

I do hope to visit the actual restaurant and will be open to changing my review. For now though, I would advise against ordering those two food items for delivery.",0,4kRvKXJUaD86S2hjuMuUIA

I was considering ordering food and dessert and decided to order dessert and eat of my friends plate. I didn't even end up eating off their plates because the wraps sucked. I ordered the surprise me crepes. Three crepes filled with surprises! I loved the concept but not the execution. One was filled with strawberries (delicious) , brownies and profiteroles. Filling a crepe with a carb is too much. It's really dry and sticks to your mouth.

Decided to try this place for the first time as I heard great things. They have a nicer dine in side, a cafe with desserts and sandwiches and a Portuguese takeout.

I got the grilled chicken blt with cheese from the cafe and two custard tarts ( also came to about $12). The best part of it all was the tarts. They were delicious. The lunch was just okay.

Made purchase & scheduled appt before 4/20 sale for my 2017 Chevy impala. Scheduled appt 1030 am. Was told I had to reschedule the day I show up which was 30 min earlier due to them being overbooked because of sale. My car was completed by 11 PM that night. 

Issues with battery because they eventually after 3 visits agreed remote wire was installed incorrectly. Issues with window tint. Back window cut to short. Both driver and passenger side had bubbles. & back side windows had dirt and noticeable leaves. Worse on driver side. Front speakers went out in less than a month. 

With 3 visits in attempt to resolve the issues there was a miscommunication with both reps at shop and the manager Stephan. I was told to reschedule each time. And not not one of the many things promised was not done due to Stephan not communicating properly with the shop reps. I Was promised different things. Car was never rewired as promised for first visit which they would have then realized it was their fault. My battery would've never drained which they did eventually replace. Only 2 windows were redone out of All except front strip that were promised would be replaced. Front speakers out of all 3 visits were never checked. I now have huge gap by my ignition switch. My steering colum was not put on correctly and now it's being rubbed when turning right. I will have to address this issue on my own. Ray (another manager involved since 3rd visit) will now not do anything to rectify the matter because he already replaced the battery they needed to replace anyway. I have not yet heard back from Stephan and most likely will not. I d0 not recommend this place to anyone. After 4 visits 8 hrs drive time total.

So I booked my room through Hotwire, room should have been paid for. I provided my credit card for incidentals and ended up getting charged an additional 175 + 303 on two separate charges. Consequently, since I didn't have that $ in my account at the time as I wasn't expecting to get charged anything, I was charged about 2 or 3 (maybe even more) overdraft fees as I had been using that card all weekend not expecting to receive any charges. So I call Westin to have this corrected and the dude that picked up the phone couldn't find me anywhere? So he tells me to call Hotwire and get the Westin confirmation #. Call Hotwire, wait on hold for about 30 minutes and get Westin confirmation #. Call Westin back, someone else answers and transfer me to accounting. Person in accounting was very helpful, but turns out I didn't need Westin confirmation # she pulled up my info no problem! So 30 minutes wasted on the phone with Hotwire. Lady in accounting says she sees the error and $ will not post to my account and they should fall off in a couple of days. In the mean time, my bank account is gonna be stuck in the negative and I can't use any of my $ until they fall off? Not to mention I'm going to have to call my bank now and get all those overdraft fees reversed.

I've used hotwire so many times and this is the first time I've ever run into this problem! Since this happened I've read other reviews on Yelp and Trip Advisor of people experiencing the same problem. This is unacceptable and needs to be addressed. Not to mention there needs to be some customer service training on handling these types of situation. When you make a $478 mistake like that customer definitely needs to feel like they are being taken care of! Whoever that dude was that answered the phone and told me to call Hotwire ... left a horrible impression on me and really makes Westin look bad.

If you are booking directly with them and don't expect to experience these problems ... it is a very nice, quiet hotel. Has a small casino in the lobby as well as Starbucks, bar, and restaurant. Customer service I experienced prior to this situation was great. The errors came from the lady that checked me in and charged my card instead of taking payment from Hotwire and from the dude who totally did not take care of me and did not know how to handle the situation.",3,hh9wMtY9P5R9Q_V6oy8D9w
z7GAft_JrFNmAH5xbVeYSA,9,2018-07-10 05:33:48,7,Zm5GQAUzlCDIEBY2J9Q5ZQ,1,"I would like to commence by stating I have been a loyal customer of Southwest Airlines for over a decade and Asif Quereshi is a valuable asset to the company and McCarran Airport. Southwest lost my loyalty on July 8th.

On the other hand, Southwest Airlines thoroughly disappointed me by their lack of communication and the service received from MARTA at Gate C22. I originally had a flight scheduled to depart from LAS to SNA at 11:15am to attend my grandmother's funeral. As I prepared to depart for the airport at 9:00am, I received notification that the flight was delayed for 12:30pm. As a result, I decided to stay in and leave at 10:15am. As the clock hit 1015am, I received another notification that the flight was moved forward to 1115am and in panic mode along with mourning of 
 mygrandmother, who raised me. 

Thanks to Southwest's poor communication, my wife and I ended up missing our flight. This was just the beginning of the greater problems to come. My wife then proceeded to speak to customer service rep, Marta. at gate C22 to seek resolution in order to make my grandmother's funeral. Instead of being helpful and trying to seek resolution, Marta did not make a single attempt to make eye contact with my wife, as she pretended to speak to someone on the phone for 8 minutes. Afterwards, Marta nonchalantly stated that there is nothing she can do. At that point, she is crying under incredible emotional distress and I witness all of it from the distance. She hysterically stated to me as she's sobbing that we are not going to make it, due to Marta's lack of customer service and empathy. 

As a result, I tried to cordially explain the situation and seek resolution with another representative in a defeated tone. In the middle of the conversation with her, Marta then proceeded to interrupt the conversation and told me to ""sit down and shut up."" As a normal protective spouse would do, I then told her to learn some customer etiquette and stormed off to a different terminal. In retaliation like a immature adolescent, she stated that my wife and I are not going home in the most sadistic manner possible. Also, she stated that she is going to call a manager to ensure that we don't get home on Southwest. Keep mind, I was publicly embarrassed by at least 25 other people who witnessed this tirade from her.

As a result, we immediately walked to a different terminal to seek resolution, my wife started talking to another CSR. Within minutes, Marta followed and told my wife to shut up and sit down.
Eventually, we were approached by Asif. He told me Marta accused me of being combative, when in reality, she was the one who told us to both shut up and failed to practice basic customer service etiquette. Asif forced at ultimatum on me and made me say sorry to the worst customer service representative at an airport. Very embarrassing to say the least.  Finally, he helped me get on a different flight to Ontario, but I still missed my grandmother's funeral. Customer service is such a simple concept executed by outstanding airlines like Korean Air and Asiana. As a result of Marta, when I think of Southwest, it reminds of the poor service from American Airlines and Delta, but exponentially worse.



Once I arrived at Ontario Airport, I had to pay $95 to take an UBER from Ontario to my home in Orange County. Southwest ruined my weekend and missing my grandmother's funeral, due Marta's lack of customer service skills, empathy, and Southwest's poor communication skills

This has been escalated to Tom Nealon, President of Southwest.",21,X421LJYkkgwZsLxAfRAY4g

I called a fee times to place my order over the phone considering I had to return to work. They never answered even though they were open. So I hopped my little but in the car and went for a drive. I arrived at this little Deli in between a art supply store and a  hair salon. Wasn't anything to be desires by the curb appeal. I entered and it appeared as if I time wrapped to the early 1990s but I digress! I placed my order, paid and waited....and waited...and waited...then waited some more. My food finally after nearly 25 minutes came to me wrapped in a typical plastic bag and screamed to be eaten! (Insert horror flic screams here!) I ordered the Latkes with Brisket and cheese. A first time meal for me,and was looking forward to it! I rushed to work, opened the package and scarfed my first gooey delish bite of pure bliss! I couldn't stop eating it! I kept shoveling the food in my mouth like a starving child! (Or a fat kid in front of cake!)

These guys sent a technician out, he was nice enough and pretty quickly diagnosed my fridge issue, and was going to order the part.  Got a call from the infamous Debbie the next day saying that this part was under mfgr warranty and not covered under the home warranty.  We called GE to have a guy come out the next day, bummed on having to pay another $100 on top of the trade fee I'd already paid to ProTech.

I looked at my mfgr warranty, and it clearly stated what was covered, and the part that Debbie said was covered - was not.  So began my 2 hours of phone calls...

Finally, after 2 calls to GE and 3 calls to the home warranty company, I got the home warranty company and GE on the line together with me, and GE clearly stated that the part in question was not covered by their warranty.

Thinking I was done, I called Debbie back, left a message (I got the answering machine 3 times I called that day - they have caller ID apparently) - and she called me back and told me that SHE had talked to GE and they said that the part was covered.  Keep in mind that I had my warranty paperwork, and had also talked to two different people at GE warranty, and they were very clear to me and the (very nice) home warranty company rep that it was not.

I offered to call them together and ask so we could get it straightened out for once and for all, but she refused.  Very impolite and combative.  If I would have told her the earth was round, she would have told me it's flat.

Looking through all of the other folks that have had bad experiences with this company, I'm a little shocked that this leading home warranty company continues to send their customers to ProTech.

So we cancelled the GE service call (saving us $100 we didn't need to spend) and were re-assigned to another company.  And yep, checked them out on Yelp!!",5,NF4qRgj-560Ul-GyITBhUw

Right around the corner from where I live is Petals....they have this FANTASTIC eyelash extension special where she'll do the whole set for $100 dollars doesn't matter if it's 30 per eye or 50 lashes per eye.  The first time I came I loved them....she did an amazing job.  I recommended her to everyone and i think 4 or 5 of my friends got them done here.  I had to take them all out because I was heading on vacation and the last thing I needed was my lashes in the way of my sun and beach (and alcohol)....When I came back I got a new set again AMAZING job when I got them...BUT 2 weeks later they all fell off and I had like 2 lashes left....It's most likely my lashes and not the technicians fault because she didnt know that my lashes are really weak and cant hold up heavy lashes.  So I came back to see her....its around 5:15pm I sat in the reception area staring out to yonge st when I notice its 5:45 hmmm my appointment was at 5:30 she should be here but I understand she travels so it's fine if shes a little late...the receptionist (very very sweet girl nothing against her) asks me if I want anything I said no i'm fine.  6:15 comes around now it's a tad ridiculous I've been sitting for about an hour...my technician isnt here and shes about 45 mins late....she told me where she lives and it doesnt take 45 mins to get here even if she left when my appointment was.  The receptionist called the technician and she had no idea that she had an appointment of that she missed an appointment earlier that morning....

Not a happy camper.  I had a huge event and had to get them done that night...the receptionist offered me a manicure which was sweet but I had to get the lashes done so I left (went to Mync Lash Lounge read my review there).   The owner called me the next day, I was at work so she left me a voicemail telling me that she apologizes and I should come in and can discuss about a discount....I never went back...

Im not sure if it was because all the lashes fell out or because she didnt show up....but it just isnt worth it to me....

HOWEVER....and this has to be made clear my friend gets her lashes done by her still and hers look AMAZING.  She hasnt had them filled in over 4 weeks and they still look GREAT....so I cant knock her technique at all....just for me personally it didnt work out.",9,-fEe8XBeJ6pGLIeAyAWzfw

We had originally planned to go to the Mongolian BBQ place nearby (called YC's, I think) but pulled in and realized that it would probably take too long to do the whole pick your meats, veggies, and sauce thing (we only had 20 minutes or so to get lunch and get to the field). That was when we spotted Gandolfo's and decided to give it a try. 

The menu was huge and really overwhelming, especially since we were in a hurry, but we both just picked something and ordered. He chose the New Yorker (roast beef sandwich served hot with pepper jack, feta, lettuce, tomato, onion, pepperoncini, butter, mayo, and oil and vinegar) and I got the Knickerbocker (which had roast beef, provolone, lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo, oil & vinegar, and salt & pepper) served hot. 

After we paid, we ended up waiting quite a while for our sandwiches  to be prepared, especially given how few people were inside. I probably wouldn't return during a weekday lunch knowing that it's not super-speedy. If you are planning to go there for lunch, make sure it's on a day where you don't need to grab your food and be back ASAP. Maybe calling ahead would help in that case. 

Also, even though the sandwiches were definitely satisfying,  they weren't outstanding. My husband, who's originally from New Jersey, didn't think the sandwiches were nearly as good as ones he's had on the East Coast. And, yes, I know we're in Phoenix, but the restaurant (which is a chain, btw) has chosen to call itself ""New York Delicatessen,"" which in all fairness, can raise a customer's expectations! I also thought the regular size of the sandwich was a bit small. If you are a big eater, I would definitely get the large. Lest you think all I have to say about Gandolfo's sandwiches is negative, I will spend a second praising the hero roll the sandwiches came on, which was freshly baked and super satisfying. 

I would definitely eat at Gandolfo's again if I were in the area and had time to wait for a sandwich, but I'm unlikely to go out of my way for it.",6,gru76BjkRY6UQVcw_yAxiQ

My friend took me over to DeSano and had been here numerous times. 

Looks can be deceiving. From the outside, looks like a restaurant as you open the doors and walk in... Feels like a brewery with picnic tables spread all over the establishment.  Very casual dining for the whole family. It's like just come as you are. No dress code.

As you walk in, menus are on the counter. Friendly staff ready to take your order as well as answer any of your questions. It's like pizza heaven here. Seeing two ovens right in front of you. Everything is made fresh and all the ingredients are from Italy. All these items are available for purchase so you can make your own pizza. Way cool. 

What I like is the size of the pizza you can order. Two sizes to select from. For two people we got the small and more than enough to share. 

After placing order, we sat down to take in the place. Wow! huge ceilings wonder if this was a textile factory or warehouse for it is so big and spacious. There is a patio and a bar area. Bar is open and staff asks if you like anything. Big Screen TV and Food Show is on for your entertainment.

Loved the ability to hang out in the hammock chairs and tan outside. The premises are clean, smell nice, the locker rooms are great. The service is fantastic.

The restaurant however was a little disappointing. The food was nothing special. The presentation of the food was beautiful but the flavors and taste were lacking. I had the fish filet and it was just okay. My friend had the arancini and loved it (I tried some and it was indeed delicious). The tuna tartare was extremely disappointing. It was cut into chunks that were too big and didn't taste very fresh, nor did it seem marinated/seasoned very well. Tartare is technically raw flesh but shouldn't taste or feel like you are eating dry unseasoned raw flesh imo. Also, they charge you the tip (""service fee"") in advance, which wasn't appreciated considering the restaurant service was most definitely not up to par with the service in the rest of the spa. We almost sensed some attitude from our server.

The massages my friend and I had (therapeutic massages) were great, the therapists were professional and listened to our needs. However the massages were not exceptional like they have been at other spas. 

Overall I would recommend to go for maybe an esthetic treatment or one of their more novel massages if you're looking for something different (like their bamboo massage for example), and to go enjoy the water circuit which seemed nice (we didn't try them) or maybe a cappuccino and some desert at the restaurant.

By the time I come home on Monday my limbs, neck and back are trashed! So, I get massages to recuperate, and the frequency is at least once every 2 weeks, and as often as once every 3 days. I have gotten 450-500 massages in my life, and I have to say that if could take one masseuse on tour with me to knead out our knots it would be Rex, the owner of the new Best Foot Spa.

Rex's new place (on Rainbow & Flamingo) is fantastically clean, warm and relaxing. Rex's wife Eileen is the perfect tag team partner if you are going in as a couple and need 2 masseuses. Where most casino and resort spas charge a premium for a 'couples massage' option, it is the norm at Best Foot Spa. I love taking out-of-town concert clients to get foot massages - and Best Foot Spa is the perfect place to do this. They can handle up to 6 customers in a single therapy room, and a total of 13 customers at one time. There are two couples rooms and a room that accomodates exactly 3 persons. I have gotten to know 2 other Best Foot Spa masseuses well (Carol & Lee) and they are also incredibly skilled.

You will get personal, kind and professional service at Best Foot Spa. This location is new and Rex is making every effort to make sure that 'everything is the best' at his new place. Well, everything at Best Foot Spa IS the best, and suddenly my weekly massage is not only therapeutic, but habit-forming as well!

Went to the M Life Counter to try and redeem MyVegas points early in the morning for breakfast. Upon arriving, with our kids, the wife went off to the side just barely visible to me and not close to any of the machines. Since there was no lines, I was immediately told any MyVegas rewards are not usable during Christmas since it was blacked out. 

I was disappointed, but I get that.  What I don't get, is the person on the floor and immediately told my wife and kids to leave since they are underage. Sure, I get that minors should not be allowed on the floor and it's not legal. But since I barely paused for a second to ask the hostess and was rudely told by the gentleman to leave before I can barely finish hearing my vouchers were not valid.....that was totally uncalled for. 

Sometimes, it's not what you say, it's how you say it...and this time, it could've been told and handled differently.  It didn't sit well with me and I didn't get a chance to voice my concern.

A couple of weeks ago I decided to bring my cousins here for lunch. Everything was fine until the bill came. All 3 of us split the bill, and I noticed that there was a charge of $4.99 on my bill. When I asked the server what the $4.99 was, he told me it's because my daughter ate. I told him that my daughter is not even 1 year old, she is only 9 Months, why am I getting charged $5 dollars for it? His response was because ""she ate"". My daughter can't even eat a lot, she had a little bit of rice and small pieces of salmon teriyaki. Still the server was still arguing that I had to pay because she ate. I told him, most restaurants ONLY charge $2.99 for children who are 2 years and older. Which I can understand, because at that age, most children can properly eat, but $4.99..... for not even eating half of a bowl of rice, that's just ridiculous! So, ended up paying because the server refused to take it out my bill. Never ever going back to this place!",1,cGYDrsPgiCZWSy5t9mFJxg

My first taste was their classic whoopie - moist chocolate cake with vanilla buttercream filling. This was super decadent. The cake was really moist and deeply chocolate. The fluffy filling was really sweet as well. It was so good; I knew I'd have to have more!

Upon my recent trip to The Union, I had to stop and get some whoopie pies. I purchased a plain vanilla, a sweet and salty (chocolate whoopie with caramel filling), and a coco-loco (chocolate whoopie with coconut filling). They come refrigerated, so I put them in the fridge when I got home. I would definitely recommend leaving them at room temperature before eating. I think they taste much better and the flavors really pop. When they are cold, it's harder to determine the flavors in the filling. Of the three I purchased, I really enjoyed to coco-loco.

Miller's provides a good selection of whatever you need, has a nice deli with deli items and prepared foods, and a pleasant, helpful staff. Sale prices are good, but overall prices are higher than the competition. Which is not a problem if quality is not an issue. Unfortunately, I have had to return bad or spoiled produce, meats with expired dates, very old seafood I could not cook, and some deli meats which tasted like plastic when I got them home. So, if you shop here, be diligent to look carefully at produce, get a taste of deli meats before buying, sniff the seafood first, and check anything with an expiration date for freshness. There are good sales on meats and I have found those for the most part to be fresh and of good quality-the chicken, beef and pork, for instance.

I couldn't even tell you the name of what we got. But it was a fantastic rice noodle dish with chicken and veggies. The flavor? It was like Thai flavors married Indian flavors and had a Cambodian child. Flavors of curry, peanut, cilantro and garlic all came together for an amazing dish. 

The spring rolls we ate were super fresh, had an interesting texture and came with this super sweet, yet tangy, dipping sauce. A rice wrapped veggie plethora of goodness I call them! The rice wrap was slightly chewy, but in a good way!
